<h2 id='c1'>CHAPTER I<br/>GORDON GETS A LETTER</h2>

<p>When Gordon Merrick neared the corner
of Troutman Street he slowed down his
bicycle and finally drew in at the curb,
putting out a foot to hold himself in the saddle while
he deliberated. So deep in thought was he that when
the yellow watering cart trundled up, the driver half
asleep under the blue and white umbrella, he never
knew of it until the sprinkler had drenched him from
foot to knee. The driver awoke at that moment and,
looking back, saw Gordon.</p>

<p>“Hi, there!” he shouted. “Look out!”</p>

<p>Gordon, aroused from his thoughts by the unexpected
bath, smiled.</p>

<p>“Why?” he asked. “Are you coming back?”</p>

<p>The joke was lost on the driver of the watering
cart, however. He only scowled and settled back to
slumber again. Gordon chuckled, and glanced ruefully
at his drenched trouser-leg. Except for the looks
of that no harm had been done, for it was a hot morning
in early July and the feeling of the cool water
against his leg had been decidedly pleasant. Evidently
the incident had brought a decision in the
weighty problem which had confronted him, for with
no more hesitation he turned his wheel to the left and
peddled on down E Street.</p>

<p>“I’ll talk to Dick about it,” he said to himself. “He
always knows what to do.”</p>

<p>The Loverings lived in the third house from the
corner, one of a half-dozen modest abodes occupying
that side of the block. All the houses were painted
white, although differing slightly in the simplicity of
their architecture, and all were more or less hidden
from view by hedges of lilac or arbor-vitæ. Old-fashioned
white picket fences peeked out between the leaves
of the hedges. The street itself was old-fashioned.
Ten years before it had been in the desirable part of
Clearfield, but since then the residential center had
worked westward and the row of quiet, green-shuttered
cottages was being closed in by such unsavory
neighbors as livery stables and dye works and tenements.</p>

<p>Dick Lovering hailed Gordon from the vine-screened
porch as the latter jumped from his bicycle and leaned
it against the hitching-post in front of the little gate.
“Hello, Gordie! Come on up.”</p>

<p>Dick was seated at the cool end of the porch, which
stretched the width of the house. There was a table
beside him which held a few flowers in a quaint old
green vase and many books and magazines. Dick’s
crutches stood against the wall within reach, for Dick,
as he put it, was “very fond of his crutches and never
went anywhere without them.” He was seventeen, a
tall, nice-looking boy with dark hair and eyes and
just the smallest suggestion of pallor on his lean cheeks.
As Gordon came up the steps Dick laid down the
magazine he had been reading and smiled his pleasant
smile.</p>

<p>“Been in the pond?” he asked, viewing the other’s
wet trousers.</p>

<p>“Watering cart soused me at the corner. How are
you, Dickums?”</p>

<p>“Fine. Swell weather, isn’t it? You look warm,
though.”</p>

<p>“So would you if you’d been riding all over town.
Say, I got a letter from Bert Cable this morning and
I want you to see what you think about it. I’ve got
it here somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Where is Bert?” asked Dick as Gordon searched
his pockets.</p>

<p>“Bridgeport, Connecticut. He’s working for his
uncle in some sort of a factory over there. He told
me he was going to get eight dollars a week. Here
it is. You’d better read it.”</p>

<p>“You do it,” smiled Dick. “I’m lazy to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, he says—Where is it?—Here we are. ‘I’m
sending a letter that came the other day from Caspar
Billings. He thinks we’re still playing ball and wants
a game with us. I haven’t answered it. What I was
thinking was why don’t you and Lansing and Fudge
Shaw and some of the fellows get a team together
and play the Point? You could have a lot of fun.
Those fellows at the Point aren’t anything to be scared
of. You could get up a team that would wallop
them easy. Tom Haley would pitch for you and Lansing
could catch and you could play first. Why don’t
you? Anyway, you answer the letter. I’m awfully
busy here and don’t have much time for writing letters.
This is a swell town, lots going on all the time
and plenty of baseball. Remember me to all the fellows
and tell Harry Bryan when you see him that he’s
got my glove and is to send it to me because I may
need it. We’re getting up a team here at the factory.
We’ve got a dandy pitcher and I guess they’ll put me
at short. Don’t forget to write to Billings anyway.
Yours truly, Bert.’”</p>

<p>Gordon looked inquiringly across at Dick. “What
do you think?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, I dare say they will.”</p>

<p>“Dare say who will? Will what?”</p>

<p>“Put Bert at short,” chuckled Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know what I mean! What do you think
of the scheme?”</p>

<p>“Good, I’d say. I suppose,” with a humorous glance
at his crutches, “you came around to see if I’d play
third base for you.”</p>

<p>“Wish you could, Dickums. Gee, I don’t see how
you can always be so cheerful about—about it! I
couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t hard, Gordie, when you’ve had seventeen
years’ practice. Of course, if I’d been able to get
around like other fellows and then—then had this
happen I guess it would be different. Anyhow, a
chap might as well be cheerful as anything else. After
all, I don’t miss much fun. I can’t play games or run or
skate or—or do a lot of things I’d like to, but I can
watch the rest of you and I can make believe that if I
<i>could</i>—well, play third base, say, I’d do it better than
the next chap. The beauty of it is that you can’t
prove I wouldn’t!”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you would, Dickums! Why, you know
more baseball and more football than most of the
fellows who play.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” laughed Dick. “They don’t have as
much time to study it as I do. They have to get out
and play. I can watch and learn. But never mind
about me. What’s this Billings chap say?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Gordon pulled another sheet of paper from
the envelope and read its contents. “‘Mr. Bert Cable,
Captain Clearfield High School Baseball Club, Dear
Sir: A lot of us fellows at the Point are getting up
a ball team and we want games. Will you play us?
We’ll play on our own field or on yours, just as you
say. Any date after July 10th will suit us, Wednesdays
or Saturdays preferred. Our fellows will average
about the same as your team, I guess. Please let
me hear from you, and if there are any other teams
around Clearfield we could play with I wish you’d let
me know and send managers’ addresses. Very truly,
Caspar Billings, Captain, Rutter’s Point Baseball Association.’”</p>

<p>“Caspar Billings,” mused Dick. “Which one of the
Silk Stocking Brigade is he, Gordon?”</p>

<p>Gordon smiled. “I don’t remember him particularly.
He’s a sort of chum of Morris Brent, though.”</p>

<p>“That all you can say for him?” asked Dick. “I
suppose Morris will play with the Pointers?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. He won’t be much of a help, though.
He plays ball like—like a turtle!”</p>

<p>“Morris says,” replied Dick with his slow smile,
“that he can play a lot better than most of you fellows
and that if Bert and Tom Haley and some of the
others weren’t down on him he’d have made the team
last spring.”</p>

<p>“Guff! He can’t catch a ball. He’s not a bad sort,
Morris, if his dad <i>does</i> own the town, but he’s no Ty
Cobb! Well, what do you think about getting up a
team, Dickums?”</p>

<p>“Why not? You’ve got plenty of fellows. Most
of the school team are still around, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“All except Bert and Warner Jones and Joe
Browne.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Warner?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Gone away with his folks somewhere
for the summer. Wish my folks would do
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, get out your pencil, Gordie, and let’s make
up the team. Haley, pitch, and Lanny, catcher<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“I’ll play first and Harry Bryan second<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“How about Will Scott?”</p>

<p>“Third. Then for shortstop<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Jack Tappen?”</p>

<p>“N-no, he’d better play in the outfield. I’ll put him
down for right. I guess Pete Robey’s the chap for
short. That leaves us Way for left field and I guess
Fudge will do for center. He can’t hit much, but he
can pull down a fly.”</p>

<p>“There you are, then. What will you call the nine?
You can’t be the High School team, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“N-no, we’ll have to find a name. The Clearfield—what,
Dickums?”</p>

<p>“Rovers?”</p>

<p>“Sounds like a troupe of trained dogs,” laughed
Gordon. “We might call ourselves the Purple Sox,
only it’s sort of hard to say.”</p>

<p>“Shorten it,” suggested Dick. “Call yourselves the
‘Purps.’”</p>

<p>“That’s worse than the Rovers! Why not just the
Clearfield Ball Club?”</p>

<p>“Why not? That’s settled. Now you want a manager<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Got one.”</p>

<p>“You have? Who?”</p>

<p>“You.”</p>

<p>“Me!”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know. That’s partly why I came.
To tell you. You see, I thought you’d want to
know it.”</p>

<p>“Very thoughtful of you,” Dick laughed. “But will
you tell me how I can manage a ball team, you idiot?”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you? All you have to do is to arrange
games for us and look after the expenses and see that
we behave ourselves. If they make me captain<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Which they will, as it’s your scheme!”</p>

<p>“It’s really Bert’s. But if they do I’m going to tell
the other fellows that they’ve got to do just as you
say. You know more baseball than I do and you’re
going to be the real thing.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p>“No nonsense about it. That’s settled, then.”</p>

<p>“But, look here, I’d have to go to places with you
and—and—well, you know, Gordie, I can’t afford to
do that very often.”</p>

<p>“It won’t cost you anything. Your expenses will
be paid by the club. Besides, we’ll only go over to
the Point and places like that, I guess. Now I’m going
to see Lanny and talk it over with him.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right. I’ll be manager if you really want
me to. I’d like it. Only, if you change your mind,
or the other fellows think<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“You know very well the other fellows will be
tickled to death,” replied Gordon severely. “And it
will be a good thing for you, too. Take you off this
porch now and then. You don’t get enough sunshine
and fresh air.”</p>

<p>“Considering that I’m outdoors all day and sleep
with my head through the window,” laughed Dick,
“that’s a bit of a joke. But have your own way,
Gordie. You always were a masterful brute. Going?”</p>

<p>“Yep. I want to catch Lanny. I’ll come over
again after dinner. Rah for the Clearfield Ball Club,
Dickums! So long!”</p>

<h2 id='c2'>CHAPTER II<br/>DICK CONSENTS</h2>

<p>“The only th-thing is,” said Fudge, “it’s going
to co-cost a heap, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Fudge, whose real name was William
Shaw, was fifteen years of age, had sandy-red hair
and blue eyes and was short of stature and round of
body. His habitual expression was one of pleased
surprise, due probably to the fact that his blue eyes
were very blue and very big. When Fudge was the
least bit excited he stammered, but the habit was too
slight to be an affliction, and his friends sometimes
got Fudge upset in order to enjoy his facial contortions
when the word wouldn’t come promptly. It
was Lansing White who, several years before in grammar
school, had dubbed him Fudge. Lanny declared
that “pshaw” and “fudge” meant the same thing and
that “fudge” was more novel. At the present moment
Fudge was seated in the apple tree which grew
by the fence where the Shaws’ side-yard and the
Merricks’ back-yard came together. It was a favorite
retreat with Fudge, and he had built a shelf handy
to the comfortable crotch he affected on which to
place books and papers when, as was customary, he
was studying his lessons there. To-day, however, as
school was over for the summer, there were no books
about and the shelf bore, instead, a tennis racket which
Fudge had been mending when Gordon found him.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why,” replied Gordon, leaning his arms
on the top of the fence. “We’ve all got our High
School uniforms and we’ve all got bats and mitts and
things. All we’d need to spend money on would be
balls, I guess. Of course, when we went away every
fellow would have to pay his transportation.”</p>

<p>“M-meaning carfare?” queried Fudge. “Say, it’s
a peach of a scheme, Gordie! I wish I could bat better,
though. Maybe I’ll get on to it, eh? I guess what
I need is practice.” And Fudge, swinging an imaginary
bat at an invisible ball, almost fell off the branch.
“Who’s going to be captain?” he asked when he had
recovered his equilibrium.</p>

<p>“We’ll vote, I suppose,” replied Gordon.</p>

<p>Fudge grinned. “Then it’ll be me. I’m awfully
popular. Have you told Lanny yet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he says if you play center there’s got to
be a rule that a hit to center field is good for only three
bases.”</p>

<p>Fudge snorted indignantly. “If he ever hit a ball
as far as the outfield he’d fall in a faint! When do
we start?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to see the other fellows yet. Harry is
working in his father’s store and I don’t know whether
his dad will let him play.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. We need him, too. He’s a peach of a
baseman. Who’s going to play short?”</p>

<p>“I want Pete Robey to,” replied Gordon doubtfully.
“Think he’d do, Fudge?”</p>

<p>“We-ell, Pete isn’t so much of a muchness. Why
don’t you p-put him in center and let me play short?”</p>

<p>“Because a fellow has to have brains to play in the
infield, Fudge, and<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>Fudge tried to reach him with the racket, failed and,
composing his features to an expression of grave interest,
asked: “Won’t it be awfully hard to find anyone
to play first?”</p>

<p>Gordon smiled. “Never you mind about first. Get
your wheel and let’s go around and see some of the
fellows. We can catch Harry at the store if we hurry.
I want to see Tom, too. If he won’t go into it and
pitch for us we might as well give it up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom’ll pitch all right,” answered Fudge, dropping
from the tree, racket in hand. “He’d rather pitch
a baseball than eat. I’ll meet you out front in two
minutes.”</p>

<p>He wormed his way through the currant bushes to
the garden path and disappeared toward the house,
while Gordon, dodging the clothes lines strung near
the rear fence, went along the brick walk and gained
the side porch by the simple expedient of vaulting the
railing. The Merrick house was new—most of the
residences on that end of Troutman Street were—and
was mildly pretentious. Mr. Merrick was a lawyer
and comfortably well-to-do. The family had lived in
Clearfield for six generations and had given its name
to one of the principal streets in the downtown business
part of the city. I refer to Clearfield as a city,
and it really was, but it was not a very large city.
The latest census credited it with something over 17,000
inhabitants. Like many New England cities of
its kind, it owed its growth and prosperity to factories
of various sorts. Mill River, which entered the bay
two miles distant, flowed along the edge of the town
and provided water-power for a number of large
manufacturing plants, knitting mills, a sewing machine
factory, a silverware factory and several others.</p>

<p>The knitting mills were largely owned by Mr.
Brent, the Honorable Jonathan Brent, as the Clearfield
<i>Reporter</i> usually referred to him, and while Gordon
had spoken of Mr. Brent “owning the town,” he
had, of course, exaggerated, but still had not been very
far wide of the mark. Mr. Brent was Clearfield’s
richest and its leading citizen. Besides the knitting
mills he controlled two banks and the street railway
and lighting service and had a finger—usually two or
three fingers—in many other enterprises. The Brent
residence, standing imposingly in a whole block of
land, was visible, further along Troutman Street,
from the Merricks’ porch. In this, the more recently
developed part of the town, the wide streets were
lined with maples as yet too young to afford much
shade, but a giant elm tree, which had been old long
before Clearfield even thought of growing away from
the river, stood just inside the Merricks’ front gate
and effectively screened the house from the hot sunlight.</p>

<p>Gordon contented himself with putting his head
inside the screen door and announcing in a loud voice:
“Mother, I’m going downtown. Is there anything you
want?” Mrs. Merrick’s voice floated down from upstairs
in reply: “No, dear; but please try to be on
time for dinner. You know your father dislikes<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>But Gordon didn’t hear the rest of it. He didn’t
need to. He knew what his father disliked. His
father disliked having him late for his meals, disliked
his going out in the evenings, disliked—oh, so many
things! Gordon sighed as he mounted his wheel.
Life was really extremely difficult at times!</p>

<p>He was a well-built, athletic youth of fifteen years,
with a pleasant, clean-cut face, dark brown eyes and
hair and a well-tanned skin. He looked very much
alive and rather enthusiastic, just the sort of a boy,
in short, to undertake and carry through successfully
such an enterprise as the formation of the Clearfield
Baseball Club.</p>

<p>Fudge was waiting for him around the corner, and
they set off together in search of Tom Haley. Tom
lived in what folks called the East End, which was
that section of the town near the railroad largely inhabited
by workers in the mills and factories. Tom’s
father was a foreman in the sewing-machine works,
and the family occupied a tiny story-and-a-half cottage
so close to the railroad tracks that it shook whenever
the trains passed. Fortunately they found Tom
at home, very busily engaged repairing the front
steps, surrounded by carpenter’s tools and three junior
members of the Haley family. He rescued the chisel
from Tille, aged four, deprived the baby of a handful
of nails, told George, aged six, to stop sawing the
chair leg, and greeted his visitors.</p>

<p>Tom was sixteen, big, broad-shouldered and raw-boned,
with an angular face and high cheek-bones liberally
speckled with freckles. At present he was minus
coat and vest and wore a pair of blue overalls. “You
kids get in the house now,” he instructed the suddenly
silent trio of youngsters, “and tell your mother to keep
you in there, too. You’ve bothered me enough. Shoo,
the whole lot of you!”</p>

<p>They went, with many backward glances, and Tom
cleared a space on the edge of the unrailed porch for
Gordon and Fudge. “Say, it’s some warm, isn’t it?
What you fellows up to to-day? Going to the
pond?”</p>

<p>“No, we’re calling on you,” replied Fudge.</p>

<p>“Much obliged. What’s the game?”</p>

<p>“Baseball,” said Gordon. “We’re getting up a
team to play the Rutter’s Point fellows and we want
you to join, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind, if there isn’t much practice. There’s
a lot to be done around the house here this summer.
We’re going to shingle next week, and after that we’ll
paint. Who’s on the team?”</p>

<p>Gordon explained all about it, read Bert Cable’s
letter and Caspar Billings’ and told Tom the line-up
of the nine as he had planned it.</p>

<p>“Sounds all right,” said Tom. “When are you going
to start?”</p>

<p>“Right away. If you’ll pitch for us we’ll be all right.
I’ll answer Billings’ letter and tell him we’ll meet him
a week from Wednesday. That’ll give us a whole week
for practicing.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’m with you, only don’t expect me to
practice much, Gordon. I’m pretty busy. I’ll come out
a couple of times, though; say—let me see—say Friday
and Monday. Going to use the school field?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t suppose anyone will object?”</p>

<p>“Don’t see why they should. You’d better see Mr.
Grayson, though.”</p>

<p>“I will. No, that will be up to Dick. He’s going
to be manager.”</p>

<p>“Dick Lovering?” asked Tom, in surprise. “Well,
I don’t see why not. He can get around all right.
Have you asked him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he said he would. The only thing is,
Tom, we’ll have to pay his expenses if we go away
from home very far. I told him we would. It
wouldn’t be much if we shared it. You see, Dick
doesn’t have much money. I guess they’re pretty
hard-up. His father only left them that house they’re
in and a little insurance money, and of course Dick
can’t do much to earn any.”</p>

<p>“He told me the other day,” said Fudge, “that he
was trying to get work tutoring this summer over at
the Point. He could do that finely if he could find
anyone to toot. Hope he does. Dick’s a peach.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have first practice Wednesday, the rest
of us, and we’ll look for you Friday, Tom. I’ve got
to catch Harry before he goes home. Maybe his
father won’t let him off. If he won’t we’ll be in a
bad way for a second baseman.”</p>

<p>“If you hold practice late—say, half-past four—I
guess Harry could get there,” said Tom. “And we
wouldn’t play more than twice a week, I suppose. Who
else are you going after besides the Pointers?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Maybe Lesterville. They’ve got
a pretty good club over there. I guess we can find
games enough, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the Springdale team has disbanded,”
said Tom. “I’d like to get another whack at those fellows!”</p>

<p>“So would I,” Gordon agreed. “We never should
have lost that last game, Tom. We all played like
idiots, though. Six errors is going some!”</p>

<p>“It was an off-day with me, all right,” grumbled
Tom. “I couldn’t put ’em over the plate to save my
life in the last four innings.”</p>

<p>“We’ll lick them at football this fall,” asserted
Fudge.</p>

<p>“Bound to,” agreed Tom, with a sly wink at Gordon.
“Fudge is going to play, you know.”</p>

<p>“You bet I am!” exclaimed Fudge. “I’m going to
p-p-play end. I’m g-g-going<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“So am I,” laughed Gordon. “Right now. Come
along, Fudge, and we’ll hunt up Harry. I’m glad
you’ll come in with us, Tom. By the way, I suppose
we ought to have a sort of meeting to organize pretty
soon. How would it do if you all came to my house
to-morrow evening? We’ll have to choose a captain
and—and talk things over.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll be captain,” said Tom. “It’s your
scheme. Besides, who else is there?”</p>

<p>“You, or Harry, or Will Scott, or<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Shucks, they’re not made for it. It’ll be either
you or Lansing, I guess. Anyway, I’ll be over to-morrow,
if you say so, about eight. So long. I’ve
got to get these boards down before dinner.”</p>

<p>They found Harry Bryan in his father’s grocery.
He, too, was very busy, but he stopped putting up
orders long enough to hear Gordon’s tale, and was instantly
enthusiastic.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to ask my dad, though,” he said doubtfully.
“He’s keeping me pretty close to business,”
he added importantly.</p>

<p>“What do you do, Harry?” asked Fudge. “Put
the sand in the sugar?”</p>

<p>Harry treated the insult with silent contempt. “I’ll
ask him to-night, though,” he continued, “and let you
know.”</p>

<p>“Telephone me, will you? We’ll have practice late
in the afternoon, Harry. You wouldn’t have to get
away until after four.”</p>

<p>“I know. I guess he will let me. He ought to.”
Harry observed the yellow slips in his hand somberly.
“I’ve been working pretty hard, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“I should think,” suggested the irrepressible Fudge,
“that if you worked late to-night you could sand
enough sugar to last the week out!”</p>

<p>“Say, they’re not going to let you play, are they,
Fudge?”</p>

<p>“How could they do without me?”</p>

<p>“It’ll be a peach of a nine!” jeered Harry. He was
only a year older than Fudge, but pretended to regard
that youth with amused toleration, and so caused
Fudge deep annoyance at times.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got eight good ones,” responded Fudge
sweetly. “If we could only find a fellow to play second
base, we’d be all right.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder they don’t put you there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was offered the position, bu-but I didn’t want
it. I prefer the outfield. There’s more re-re-responsibility
there.”</p>

<p>“You’re a wonder!” said Harry. “What would you
do if a ball came your way? Hold your mouth open
and try to swallow it?”</p>

<p>“You wa-wait and see! If I co-co-couldn’t catch a
b-b-ball better th-th-than you<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, Fudge! You’re off your trolley
again! I’ll be around to-morrow night, Gordon. Now
I’ll have to get busy. Watch Fudge as he goes out,
will you? Last time he was in he got away with three
or four pounds of prunes.”</p>

<p>“I took three of the old th-th-th-things,” said Fudge
bitterly, “and they n-n-nearly killed me!”</p>

<p>They left Harry surrounded by baskets, frowning
over the order slips in his hand, and made their way
back to the sidewalk and their wheels. As it was almost
noon, Gordon decided not to risk his father’s displeasure
by seeing any more of the fellows before
dinner, and he and Fudge pedaled home, Fudge still
sputtering about those prunes.</p>

<p>At a little after four that afternoon Gordon was
back at Dick’s to report success. All the members of
the Clearfield Ball Club had agreed to play and to
attend the organization meeting the next evening—all,
that is, save Harry Bryan, who was to telephone
later.</p>

<p>“Now, Dickums, if you’ll write to Billings and tell
him<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“If <i>I’ll</i> write!”</p>

<p>Gordon laughed. “Of course; you’re the manager,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Humph! So I have to attend to the correspondence
too, do I? It seems to me that you ought to
write that letter. Bert sent it to you, and you’re captain,
and<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what I thought,” responded Gordon
cheerfully, “until I got to thinking it over. Then I
remembered that you were manager, and, of course,
managers always attend to arranging contests; and
there you are. Just tell him we’ll play his team on
Wednesday the sixteenth, Dickums, at the Point.”</p>

<p>“All right. I might call on him and tell him about
it, though, for I’m going over to the Point in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“You are? What for?”</p>

<p>“To get a job, I hope. You know I got them to
put up a notice in the hotel over there for me: ‘tutoring
in French, Mathematics, and English; references;
terms on request.’ This afternoon a Mrs. Townsend
called me up by telephone, and she wants me to come
over in the morning and see about coaching her son.
He’s going to Rifle Point School in the Fall and is
weak on English and Math. He’s thirteen, she says.
She seemed to think the price was all right, but she
wants me to have a look at the youngster first. Sounded
as though she was afraid I wouldn’t like him.
I’d coach a Bengal tiger if I got paid for it. I need
the money, Gordie.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine! Then why not see Billings instead
of writing to him? You could arrange the whole
thing in five minutes. Do you know where he lives?”</p>

<p>“No, but they can tell me at the hotel, I guess. By
the way, why do you want to play over there? Why
not have them come over here?”</p>

<p>“Because I saw Mr. Grayson awhile ago and asked
him if it would be all right if we used the school field,
and he said it would as far as he was concerned, but
that he’d just got notice from Mr. Brent that they are
going to cut the field up pretty soon for building lots.
I suppose we could use it until they begin to build on
it, but I haven’t seen Mr. Brent yet, and I thought it
would be safer to say we’d play them at the Point.
They’ll probably want another game, and then, if it’s
all right about the field, we could play them here.”</p>

<p>“But that will leave us without an athletic field!”
exclaimed Dick, in dismay. “I thought we had a lease
or something on it.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Grayson says not. Says Mr. Brent just agreed
to let us use it as long as it wasn’t needed for anything
else. Now he wants it put in the market for
house lots. Rather tough, isn’t it? I guess we can
find another field somewhere, though.”</p>

<p>“Not in town,” said Dick. “We’ll probably have to
go across the river somewhere. There are plenty of
fields over there, but they’re as rough as the dickens.
What did Mr. Grayson say about that?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. He seemed to think it was up to
the Athletic Committee.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is, but he’s principal, and<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Shucks, he wouldn’t care a lot if we didn’t have a
field, I guess!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that, Gordie. Grayson’s not very
keen about our athletics, I know, but he’s been pretty
decent, just the same. We’ll have to get busy right
away and find a new place. The football fellows will
want to start practice in something like two months.
Does Way know about it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I saw Grayson after I left Way. I
don’t believe he does, for he didn’t say anything. He
will have to get the committee together and have a
meeting, I guess. Who’s on it now?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, not this year. There’s Way, and Harry, and
Bert<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Well, Bert can’t come. I think Will Scott is on it,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Maybe; he probably is if Way belongs. Well, it’s
up to Way. I thought I’d ask Mr. Brent if we could
keep on using the field for a while; or have Morris ask
him. I dare say he’d be more likely to say yes if Morris
asks him. Come to think of it, Dickums, as you’re
manager<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t! I wouldn’t beard old man Brent in
his den for a hundred dollars! If I’ve got to do that,
I’ll resign!”</p>

<p>“All right, then, I’ll do it!” laughed Gordon. “Or
I’ll see Morris about it. I don’t see why he needs to
cut up that field, though. Seems to me there are
enough houses in this town already.”</p>

<p>“Wants the money, probably. Bet you Jonathan
Brent would cut up the Garden of Eden for house
lots if he had it!”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to care a whole lot for Mr. Brent,
Dickums.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” responded Dick emphatically. “We
wouldn’t be like we are now—as poor as church mice—if
father hadn’t got mixed up with Mr. Brent in
one of his real-estate schemes. I’m not saying that
Mr. Brent was dishonest, Gordie, but he was too sharp
for dad, and dad got let in for a pile of money.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that,” said Gordon. “You never
told me, did you?”</p>

<p>“No. It was a long time ago, when I was just a
kid. Dad moved here from Norwalk when I was
three years old. He had quite a little money—thirteen
or fourteen thousand dollars it was—and Mr.
Brent got him to invest it in that South-west Division,
as they called it. They got hold of a pile of land down
the river toward the Point. You know; where the picnic
grove is. They were going to sell it for factory
sites and there was a railway coming through to connect
with the Shore Line, and everything was fine—on
paper. But the bottom fell out of the scheme; the
factories didn’t come, and the railroad decided not to
build; and the mortgages were foreclosed; and after
it was all over Mr. Brent had the whole thing and dad
had nothing! And it was all legal and above-board,
too! And that’s why I’ve never had much use for
Jonathan Brent; nor Morris, either, although Morris
has never done anything to me.”</p>

<p>“You and he seem to be pretty good friends,” said
Gordon.</p>

<p>“I know. He<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span> Well, he seems to like me pretty
well, and you can’t be anything but decent to a fellow
in that case, can you? I suppose if Jonathan Brent
wasn’t his father I’d like him well enough. Well, I’ll
stop in and see this Billings chap to-morrow. It’s
less trouble than writing a letter, I guess. Wednesday
the sixteenth, on their own grounds, at—what
time?”</p>

<p>“Three o’clock, I suppose,” answered Gordon.
“That will give us plenty of time to get over on the
two-o’clock car and warm up a bit before the game.
You might tell him about our field, and say that if they
want a return game we’ll play it over here if we can
get the use of the field. By the way, that grandstand
at the field belongs to the school. We’ll have to move
that if we get out. I wish Mr. Brent would be satisfied
with all the money he’s got and not go and take
our field away from us.”</p>

<p>“So do I. What we want to do, though, is to watch
out and be sure he doesn’t swipe the grandstand too!”</p>

<p>“Well, you <i>are</i> rabid!” laughed Gordon. “Still, I
don’t know that I blame you. I never knew that about
your father, Dickums.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t repeat it, please. It’s all done with
now, and there’s no use talking about it. I don’t—very
often. Only sometimes<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span> Well, I get sort of
hot under the collar when I think of all the money Jonathan
Brent has and how awfully hard we have to
scrabble to get along. Good-bye, Mr. Captain.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Mr. Manager. I’m not captain, though.”</p>

<p>“You will be,” laughed Dick. “You always are,
you know!”</p>

<h2 id='c3'>CHAPTER III<br/>A RICH MAN’S SON</h2>

<p>Gordon had doubts of finding Morris Brent
at home when, shortly after nine o’clock the
next morning, he walked up the neat artificial-stone
path to the front door of Brentwood. But
the maid who responded to his ring assured him that
Master Morris was in, and led the way to the gray-and-gold
reception room. He decided to take no
chances with the spindle-legged, silk-brocaded chairs,
and took refuge in front of the mantel, from which
place he viewed the gray satin wall panels and dainty
luxuries of the apartment with surprise. He didn’t
have to wait long, however, for he had only just
reached the conclusion that the room was pretty but
uncomfortable when footsteps sounded quickly in the
hall and a boy a year older than he appeared in the
doorway.</p>

<p>“Hello, Gordon! How are you? Say, what did
they put you in here for? This room gives me the
creeps, doesn’t it you? Come on out on the
piazza.”</p>

<p>Gordon followed his host across the hall, through
a warm-toned, luxurious but decidedly comfortable library
and out of a French door onto a wide porch that
was screened and curtained. There were many bright
rugs and gayly cushioned easy-chairs here; and tables
with blossoming plants and books and magazines on
them. From the porch one looked across a carefully
kept lawn to where a symmetrically clipped hedge bordered
Louise Street. Mr. Brent owned not only the
block on which his estate was located, but some eight
or nine adjoining blocks besides, his property running
from his back line across Troutman, Lafayette, Main,
and Common Streets to the river, including, two
blocks north, the plot of land which for many years
the High School had used as an athletic field. Mr.
Brent had laid out the section himself and had named
the two cross streets after his son and daughter, Morris
and Louise.</p>

<p>Morris was a good-looking youth, with a self-confident
air and a somewhat dissatisfied expression. He
was tall, carried himself well, dressed rather more expensively
than his companions in high school, and was
never quite able to forget or allow others to forget that
he was Jonathan Brent’s son and heir. But, in spite of
that, he was not unpopular, and if there was any
snobbishness about him it was unconscious. In fact, there
were one or two of his acquaintances in Clearfield to
whom he went out of his way to ingratiate himself.
Gordon was one and Dick was another. But Gordon
had never cared to respond more than half-heartedly
to Morris’ advances, while Dick’s attitude we already
know.</p>

<p>Morris pulled forward the most comfortable chair
for his guest, repeated that he was glad to see him,
and for several minutes gave Gordon no chance to
state his errand. When he did, however, Morris was
as much surprised as Dick had been.</p>

<p>“Dad hasn’t mentioned it to me,” he said, with a
frown. “That’s too bad, isn’t it? I don’t see why he
needs to cut up that land just now. What’ll we do,
Gordon, for a place to play?”</p>

<p>“Dick said he supposed we’d have to go across the
river. That would make it pretty far from school,
though. But I don’t know of any place in town, do
you?”</p>

<p>Morris shook his head, and Gordon went on:</p>

<p>“What I wanted to see you about was to ask if you
thought your father would have any objection to our
using the field until they began to build on it. I don’t
think they’ve done anything there yet. I thought maybe
you wouldn’t mind asking your father, Morris.”</p>

<p>Morris hesitated a moment. “I’ll ask him,” he said,
at last, “but he and I—well, we aren’t on very good
terms just now. Honestly, I think it would be better
if you asked him yourself, Gordon. I’m afraid he’d
say no to me just to—to be nasty. You see, we had a
sort of row about an automobile. He kind of promised
last Christmas that he’d get me a runabout this
Spring, and when I asked about it he put me off; and
so I”—Morris grinned—“I went ahead and got Stacey
to order one for me. It came yesterday, and I told
dad and he got as mad as a hatter about it. Says I
can’t have it now. I’m going to, though. I’ve got
some money in the bank, and Stacey says he’ll wait
for the rest of it. It’s only six hundred dollars, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Too bad!” murmured Gordon, not very enthusiastically.
“Maybe he will change his mind, though.”</p>

<p>“Not he! He isn’t made that way. What are you
going to do at the field? Play ball?”</p>

<p>Gordon told about the letter from Caspar Billings
and the formation of the ball club. “I suppose,” he
ended, “you’ll play with the Point fellows?”</p>

<p>Morris shrugged his shoulders. “I suppose so. I
haven’t heard anything about it yet. Caspar’s a friend
of mine, though. We don’t move out to the Point
until the seventeenth this summer. Dad’s full of business
and as grouchy as the dickens. Sis and I have
been trying to get mother to spunk up and insist on
moving right away, but she won’t. Who’s on your
team, Gordon?”</p>

<p>Gordon told him. Morris criticised several of his
selections and was infinitely amused at the idea of
Fudge Shaw playing. Gordon had an uneasy feeling
that Morris perhaps resented not being asked to join.
But if Morris held any resentment, he didn’t show it.</p>

<p>“We ought to have some good games,” he said
finally and approvingly. “I dare say Caspar will want
me to play on his team. You know him, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Gordon was doubtful. “I think I remember him,”
he said, “but I’m not sure. What does he look like?”</p>

<p>“Oh, rather a good-looking chap—big, dark hair,
plays tennis a lot and is pretty good at it. He lives
in a cottage near the hotel, the second in the row at
the left. He’s a dandy chap, Billings. I don’t see,
though, where he’s going to get enough fellows at the
Point to make up a nine, unless there are more there
this year than usual. Perhaps he’s got some fellows
staying with him. He goes to St. George’s, you know,
and last year he brought a couple of friends home with
him for a while.”</p>

<p>“Dick went over to the Point this morning to see
about coaching a boy who is going to Rifle Point in
the Fall,” said Gordon. “He’s going to look up
Billings and tell him we’ll play him a week from Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Could Dick do that? Coach, I mean.”</p>

<p>“I guess so. You know he’s about the smartest
fellow in his class at school. He wants to earn some
money, and there aren’t many things he can do. I
hope he gets the job.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I like Dick. He’s terribly white, isn’t he?
Gee, if I had a bum hip like his and had to live on
crutches, I’d—I’d<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>” But words failed him. He
shook his head. “He’s so awfully cheerful. Who is
the kid he’s going to coach?”</p>

<p>“I’ve forgotten the name. He told me. Something
like Prentiss, I think.”</p>

<p>Morris shook his head again. “Don’t know them.
They must be new. When I get over there, Gordon,
I’ll see if I can’t drum up some trade for Dick. I
know about everyone there.” He paused, and then
added morosely, with a wry smile: “It might be a
mighty good scheme if I had him coach me a bit. I’ve
got to take my college exams next year, and I know
blamed well I won’t pass them.” He shrugged his
shoulders. “Well, I’ve got another year yet. Do
you have to go? Stay and play a couple of sets of
tennis with me. You’ve never tried our court, have
you?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to, but I want to get this business settled.
I guess I’d better go and see your father about the
field. I’d like to play, though, some time,” he added,
as he saw Morris’ face fall. “It looks like a bully
court.”</p>

<p>“It is. It’s a dandy. Fast as lightning. I haven’t
played much myself this year, and I’m all out of trim.
Sis and I had a couple of sets the other day, and she
pretty nearly licked me.”</p>

<p>“I hope your sister is well,” murmured Gordon.
“And Mrs. Brent.”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks. Sis ought to be around somewhere.
Wait till I see.”</p>

<p>He got up and passed into the library, and Gordon
heard him calling his sister at the stairway. He came
back in a moment. “She’s coming down,” he announced.
“Don’t hurry off. Dad will be in his office
all the morning, I guess. I hope you don’t mind my
not wanting to ask him, Gordon. I would in a minute,
only, as I say, we aren’t very chummy just now.”</p>

<p>At that moment Louise Brent came through the
doorway, and Gordon, who had reseated himself after
his first start to leave, arose again. She was tall, like
her brother, but, unlike him, was light in coloring,
with brown hair that just escaped being yellow and a
very fair skin and blue eyes. She was not a beauty,
but she was pretty in spite of irregular features, with a
lot of animation and a smile that won friends at once.
She was fifteen; but she looked older, Gordon thought
as he took the hand she extended.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen you for a long time, Gordon,” she
said, as she seated herself on the edge of Morris’ chair.
“Not since the school dance in January. And then
you didn’t ask me for a single dance.”</p>

<p>Gordon smiled a trifle embarrassedly. “I—I don’t
dance very well,” he said. “I thought it would be
kinder to spare you.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t spare Grace Levering,” she laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, Grace<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Is awfully nice. I know.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that! I meant that—she’s only thirteen—and<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m too old?” Louise opened her eyes very
wide. “But I’m only fifteen, Gordon. How old are
you? Or isn’t it polite to ask?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen, too,” he laughed. “I guess the reason I
danced with Grace so much was because I thought she
wasn’t old enough to be fussy about the way I did it.
Kind of tough on her, though, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Kind of tough on the rest of us, you mean,” responded
Louise. “You’ll have to make it up this summer
by coming to some of our parties at the Point.
Will you?”</p>

<p>“Why—yes, if you want me to. But, really and
truly, I’m a fierce dancer, Louise.”</p>

<p>“Is he?” She turned to her brother. Morris shook
his head.</p>

<p>“Search me. I know he can bat a ball like sixty,
though. I’ve been trying to get him to stay and play
some tennis, but he won’t. You ask him, sis.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you?” she begged. “The court’s just crying
to be played on. If you will, I’ll bring you out
the biggest, coldest pitcher of lemonade, Gordon, you
ever saw!”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but—some other time<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“That means never!” she sighed. “I don’t think
you’re as nice as you used to be. Is he, Morris?”</p>

<p>“He’s so full of business these days. Say, sis, father’s
going to cut up the athletic field for building lots.
What do you think of that?”</p>

<p>“What for?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Search me. It leaves the school in a hole, all
right.”</p>

<p>“How horribly mean!” said Louise. “It was such
a nice field, too! I don’t think he ought to do it, Morris,
and I guess I’ll tell him so.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead!” laughed her brother. “It’ll make a
lot of difference—I don’t think! Gordon came around
to get me to ask dad to let the fellows use the field
until he began to cut it up, but I told him that he’d
better do the asking himself. If I asked he might
give orders to build a dozen houses on it to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“I know.” Louise nodded. “I wish you’d give up
the idea of that automobile, Morris. Mother doesn’t
want you to have it, either.”</p>

<p>“Just because dad made such a fuss,” he grumbled.
“She was all right before that. I’m going to have it,
just the same.”</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t,” she murmured. “Do you
think he ought to drive an auto, Gordon? Don’t you
think it’s too dangerous?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Gordon. “I’ve never had
much experience with automobiles. I suppose, though,
that if one is careful<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Morris won’t be,” mourned Louise. “He’ll have
an accident, kill himself, break his arm or something.”</p>

<p>“Oh, piffle, sis! I can run an automobile as well as
any chap. I’ve done it. When I get the car you’ll be
tickled to death, and you’ll want to be riding in it
every minute.”</p>

<p>Louise shook her head energetically. “No, I shan’t,
Morris. I’d be scared to death. And I think it would
be much better for you to wait another year or two.
Papa won’t like it a bit if you take your money out of
the bank and spend it on an automobile.”</p>

<p>“It’s my money, and I have a right to do as I
please with it,” responded her brother. “Besides, if
he’d kept his word<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, Morris, you shouldn’t say things like that!
Papa never actually told you you could have it.”</p>

<p>“Well, he as much as told me,” muttered Morris.
“Anyway, I’m going to have it. Stacey would think
I was a pretty funny sort if I refused to take it after
he’d got it for me.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he could sell it to someone else,” suggested
Gordon. “’Most everyone is buying the things
nowadays. Well, I’ll be going, I guess. Good-bye.
Good-bye, Louise. I’ll come over some time and have
that tennis, Morris, if you’ll let me know.”</p>

<p>“Come whenever you can, will you? I’m at home
most of the time; or I shall be until I get my car.”
And Morris grinned exasperatingly at his sister.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget that you’re to come to the Point
some time and dance every dance with me,” Louise
reminded, as she and Morris accompanied Gordon to
the door. “That’s the only apology I’ll accept.”</p>

<p>“You’ll wish you hadn’t invited me after the first
dance,” replied the visitor grimly. “But I’ll come if
you want me to some time. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>On his wheel once more, and spinning down the
shadow-dappled street, he thought, not without a little
natural envy, how fine it must be to have as much
money as the Brents. Morris had spoken of buying a
six-hundred-dollar automobile in much the same way
as Gordon might have announced his intention of purchasing
a new suit of clothes! And yet, on reflection,
Morris didn’t seem really happy and contented, and
never had. He always appeared to have a quarrel
with someone or something. Sometimes it was the
teachers at High School, who were imposing on him;
once it had been the baseball coach, Mr. Farrel, who,
according to Morris, was keeping him off the team
for spite, and now it was with his father. It would
seem, then, that the possession of much wealth didn’t
always bring contentment. There was Dick Levering,
who was not only poor but a cripple as well, and who
was absolutely the most cheerful and contented fellow
of all Gordon’s acquaintances. It was a bit puzzling,
Gordon thought, as he whirled into E Street and
headed toward the business section of town.</p>

<p>Mr. Jonathan Brent’s office was in the Clearfield
Trust Company’s Building, opposite the common.
Gordon left his wheel against the curb and mounted
the flight of marble stairs. A clerk took his name
doubtfully and indicated a chair for him to sit in
while he waited Mr. Brent’s pleasure. As it happened,
although the mill president was a very busy man, Gordon
didn’t have to wait long. Almost at once a buzzer
sounded, the clerk disappeared, returned, and conducted
Gordon through a door whose ground-glass
pane was marked “Private.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brent’s office looked out across E Street into the
elm-shaded greenery of the common. An electric fan
made a soft and pleasant whirring from the top of the
big desk which, until Gordon had crossed the room,
hid Mr. Brent from view. A chair was set at the end
of the desk and into this, not very confidently, Gordon
lowered himself while Mr. Brent, without looking up,
ran his eye over a letter in his hand.</p>

<p>Jonathan Brent was a small man, small and narrow,
with a lean and wrinkled face, shrewd but not
unkindly, and a pair of gimlet-like, blue-gray eyes.
His face was clean-shaven and the grizzled brown
hair had retreated until the top of his head was as
bald and shining as the white-enameled newel-post at
the foot of the Merricks’ stairway. His mouth was
thin and set in a firm, straight line, a line that never
altered as, presently, he laid down the paper in his
hand and raised his gaze to Gordon’s.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want, my boy?” he asked, in
a quick but not unpleasant voice.</p>

<p>“I came to see you about the athletic field, Mr.
Brent,” responded Gordon. “I heard yesterday that
you intend to cut it up for building lots, sir.”</p>

<p>“Quite right. What of it?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, you see we’ve been using it for baseball,
and some of us are getting up a nine to play this summer,
and I wondered if you’d let us use it until you got
ready to—to build on it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I see. What’s your name? Herrick?”</p>

<p>“Merrick, sir; Gordon Merrick.”</p>

<p>“Ellis Merrick’s boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I know your father. Are you in the High School?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Know my boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I—I went to see him this morning. I
thought maybe he would ask you for me, but—he<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>Gordon floundered, and a tiny smile moved the corners
of Mr. Brent’s straight lips.</p>

<p>“He didn’t care to, eh? Well, Merrick, you’re
welcome to use the field as long as you don’t interfere
with the engineers or workmen. I believe they’re
going to survey there for the street in a week or so.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Brent.”</p>

<p>“All right. I dare say you boys are going to miss
that playground.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, we are. It—it’s been a fine place for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Sorry I can’t let you have the use of it
longer, but I need the ground. I suppose you can find
another field without much trouble.”</p>

<p>“I think so,” agreed Gordon doubtfully.</p>

<p>“You and Morris friends?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. That is, we—we know each other pretty
well.”</p>

<p>“Only pretty well, eh? What’s the matter? Don’t
you like him?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sir, but—but we don’t see each other
much.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t he like you?”</p>

<p>“I think so. He seems to.”</p>

<p>“Did he say anything to you about an automobile,
Merrick?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he mentioned it.” Gordon began to wish
himself away.</p>

<p>“Ever drive one of the things?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Like to?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I guess so. I think it would be fun to—to
have one.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t your father get you one?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he could afford it, and, besides<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Yes? Besides?”</p>

<p>“I guess he wouldn’t think I was—was old enough
to run it.”</p>

<p>“How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen, sir.”</p>

<p>“Morris is sixteen. Think your father would let
you have one if you were a year older and he could
afford it?”</p>

<p>Gordon shook his head. “I don’t believe so, Mr.
Brent.”</p>

<p>“I don’t, either. Well, help yourself to the field,
Merrick. Glad to have met you. Good day.”</p>

<h2 id='c4'>CHAPTER IV<br/>THE TEAM ELECTS ITS CAPTAIN</h2>

<p>There was a full attendance at the organization
meeting which assembled in the Merricks’
front parlor that evening. Besides
Gordon himself, Dick Lovering, Fudge Shaw, Harry
Bryan, who had won his father’s consent, and Tom
Haley, all of whom we have met, there was Lansing
White, otherwise known as “Lanny,” Jack Tappen,
Pete Robey, Will Scott, and Curtis Wayland. Curtis
and Will were inseparable companions. Damon and
Pythias would have been excellent, if hackneyed,
nicknames for the pair. Dick had once remarked in
his quiet way, when the two chums had appeared arm
in arm on the ball field: “Where there’s a Will there’s
a Way.” Thereafter Curtis was called Way, and
Dick’s pun was handed over to an appreciative public
in the “Caught-in-the-Corridor” column of <i>The Purple</i>,
the High School monthly. Way and Will were
both of an age, which was sixteen, both of the same
height to a fraction of an inch, and, perhaps by reason
of having been together ever since they were in
kindergarten, were so much alike in general appearance,
manners, and speech that they were always mistaken
for brothers and not infrequently for twins.
Way was a little heavier in build than Will, and had
dark brown hair, whereas Will’s was light. For the
rest they were much the same, with brown eyes, short
noses, and round, freckled faces. Good, healthy, jolly,
normal boys both.</p>

<p>Pete Robey was fifteen, a lank, dark-eyed fellow,
rather diffident and quiet. Jack Tappen was only
fourteen, but he was big for his years. He was not
at all diffident. In fact, Jack had a pretty good opinion
of himself. He was a clever ball player, and, for
that matter, did many things about as well as the older
fellows with whom he associated.</p>

<p>Lansing White, or Lanny, as he was always called,
was fifteen. Every one who knew him would have
assured you earnestly that Lansing White was destined
for great things. Perhaps they were right. At
all events, he had the fine faculty of making friends on
the instant and holding them. There wasn’t a kinder-hearted
fellow in school, nor one more thoughtful of
others. If a ballot had been taken for the most popular
student, Lanny would have won, hands-down, over
many a fellow far more prominent in school affairs.
He caught for the school nine, played a fine game at
left halfback on the football team, and regularly won
his five points in each of the sprints at the track meetings
with Springdale High School.</p>

<p>In appearance he was rather striking by reason of
his hair, which was as near the color of ripe flax as
hair ever gets, and his eyes which were so dark a
brown that they looked black. The contrast between
light hair and dark eyes was rather startling. He was
always a little too lean, his parents thought, but his
leanness was quite healthy and was due, probably, to
the fact that he was always in training for something.</p>

<p>The nine members of the Clearfield Ball Club sat
around the parlor, occupying every available chair and
couch, and discussed the project exhaustively and with
enthusiasm. They all agreed that it was the bounden
duty of someone to humble the pride of those Rutter’s
Point chaps, to whom they had long been in the habit
of referring as the Silk Stocking Brigade; and they
didn’t see but what the duty could be performed by
them as well as by any others. Jack Tappen thought
they could attend to it a little better than any others,
and so declared. That point agreed on, they discussed
ways and means. Everyone there except Fudge
and Pete Robey had a High School uniform which it
would, they decided, be quite permissible to wear.
Fudge declared that he would buy a uniform, and Pete
was sure he could borrow one. Gordon’s announcement
that Dick had been tendered and had accepted
the position of manager met with acclaim, and Will
and Way, in the same breath, demanded a speech.
Dick declined to address the meeting, contenting himself
with reminding the turbulent pair that as manager
he had the power to fine them for misconduct. At
which Will and Way, pretending to be much alarmed,
subsided. It was agreed that every member was to
pay his own car-fares when the team journeyed from
home, and that the manager’s expenses were to be provided
for by an assessment on each of one-ninth of
the necessary amount. Dick claimed the floor, there to
state that it would probably not be necessary for the
others to provide his expenses, and that in any case he
would pay his own way unless the team journeyed a
long distance.</p>

<p>The name of the team was decided on—the Clearfield
Baseball Club. Harry Bryan was in favor of
something with more “snap” to it, something like the
Clearfield Pirates or the Clearfield Giants, but he was
defeated. Dick, who had taken the proceedings in
hand, then announced that the election of a captain
was in order, and Tom Haley, Fudge, and Jack Tappen
nominated Gordon in unison. The others signified
approval noisily. Gordon, however, insisted on
being heard.</p>

<p>“You fellows don’t have to make me captain,” he
protested, “just because I started the thing going. It
wasn’t my idea, anyhow; it was Bert Cable’s. I’ll be
captain if you really want me, but I think some of the
rest of you would be better, and I nominate Tom.”</p>

<p>“Nominate all you like,” grunted Tom Haley. “I
decline.”</p>

<p>“I nominate Lanny,” said Will Scott.</p>

<p>“Second the nomination!” piped up Way.</p>

<p>“Much obliged, fellows,” said Lanny, “but I’d
rather not. Let’s make Gordon captain and not be
scared out of it. All in favor make a lot of noise!”</p>

<p>There was a lot of noise, a very great deal of noise,
and Dick laughingly declared Gordon elected.
“Speech! Speech!” shouted the irrepressible Fudge,
beating a tattoo on the hardwood floor with his heels.</p>

<p>“Shut up, Fudge! And stop denting the floor with
those hob-nailed shoes of yours. I saw Mr. Brent this
morning, and asked him if we could use the field as
long as it wasn’t wanted for anything else, and he said
we could. So I propose that if the Point plays us a
return game we play on our own grounds. Now,
about practice. You fellows know we’ve got to get
together and have a good lot of real work before we
run up against those Point fellows. So I say let’s
have practice every afternoon next week at four-thirty.
Maybe after next week every other day will do, but
we don’t want to let those silk-sox chaps beat us, and
so we’ve got to practice hard. Will all you fellows
agree to come to practice every afternoon? That
doesn’t mean Tom, because he’s got a lot of work to
do, and, besides, we don’t need him so much. He will
come as often as he can. But the rest of us ought to
get out every day.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Jack Tappen. “If we’re going
into this thing, let’s go into it with both feet.
There’s no reason I can see why we shouldn’t have as
good a baseball team as there is in this part of the
state. We all know the game pretty well<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, you right-fielder!” exclaimed Fudge.</p>

<p>“<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>And most of us have played together this
Spring. And with Gordon for captain we ought to
just everlastingly wipe up the county!”</p>

<p>Loud applause greeted this enthusiastic statement,
and Fudge began his tattoo again, but was cautioned
by a well-aimed pillow which, narrowly avoiding a
vase on a side table, eclipsed his joyous countenance
for an instant.</p>

<p>“I guess,” said Lanny, “that we can all get out and
practice; can’t we, fellows? In fact, Gordie, it might
be a good plan to have it understood that any fellow
not turning up, without a real, genuine excuse, is to
pay a fine.”</p>

<p>“How much?” demanded Fudge anxiously.</p>

<p>“Half a dollar,” suggested Will.</p>

<p>“A quarter,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“A quarter’s enough, I guess,” said Dick. “How
about it? Everyone agree?”</p>

<p>“Who’s going to decide whether the excuse is a
good one?” inquired Fudge.</p>

<p>“Dick,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>Fudge sighed with relief. “All right. Dick’s a
friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“Then Wednesday at four-thirty, fellows,” said
Gordon, “and bring your bats. By the way, there’s
one thing we’ve forgotten: We’ll have to buy balls.
Suppose we all chip in a half to start with?”</p>

<p>That was agreed to, and the meeting was served
with lemonade and cakes and adjourned, everyone departing
save Dick, Lanny, and Fudge. These, with
Gordon, went out to the porch and took possession of
the front steps. There was a fine big moon riding in
the sky, and, since Clearfield was economical and did
not illuminate the streets in the residence districts
when the moon was on duty, it had no competition.
The leafy shadows of the big elm fell across the porch,
blue-black, trembling as a tiny breeze moved the
branches above. Dick leaned against a pillar and laid
his crutches between his knees, and the others grouped
about him. Perhaps the refreshments had worked a
somnolent effect on them, or perhaps the great
lopsided moon stared them into silence. At all events,
nothing was said for a minute or two, even Fudge,
usually an extremely chatty youth, having for once no
observations to offer. It was Gordon who finally
broke the stillness.</p>

<p>“Some moon,” he said dreamily.</p>

<p>“Great!” agreed Lanny. “You can see the man in
it plainly to-night.”</p>

<p>“Supposing,” said Fudge thoughtfully, “supposing
you were terribly big, miles and miles high, and you
had a frightfully huge bat, couldn’t you get a
d-d-dandy swipe at it!”</p>

<p>“You could make a home run, Fudge!” laughed
Lanny. “Only you’d have to hit pretty quick. Why,
if you were tall enough to reach the moon, it would
be going past you faster than one of Tom’s straight
ones, Fudge!”</p>

<p>“Quite a bit faster,” agreed Gordon. “Still, it
would be ‘in the groove,’ and if you took a good
swing and got your eye on it you could everlastingly
bust up the game!”</p>

<p>“I think,” replied Fudge, who had literary yearnings,
“I’ll write a story about a giant who did that.”</p>

<p>“Well, there are some pretty good hitters among
the ‘Giants,’” commented Dick gravely. Fudge
snorted.</p>

<p>“You know wh-wh-what I mean!” he said severely.</p>

<p>“Of course he does,” agreed Lanny. “Dick, you
oughtn’t to poke fun at Fudge’s great thoughts.
Fudge is a budding genius, Fudge is, and if you’re
not careful you’ll discourage him. Remember his
story about the fellow who won the mile race in two
minutes and forty-one seconds, Dick? That was a
peach of a<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“I didn’t!” declared Fudge passionately. “The
p-p-printer made a mistake! I’ve told you that a
th-th-th-thousand t-t-times! I wrote it<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Don’t spoil it,” begged Dick. “It was a much better
story the way <i>The Purple</i> printed it. Any fellow
might run the mile in four-something, but to do it
under three shows real ability, Fudge. Besides, what’s
a minute or two in a story?”</p>

<p>“Aw, cu-cu-cut it out!” grumbled Fudge. “You
f-f-fellows m-m-m-m<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“You’ll never do it, Fudge,” said Gordon sympathetically.
“I’ve noticed that if you don’t make it the
first two or three times you<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>M-make me tired!” concluded Fudge breathlessly
but triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Snappy work!” approved Lanny. “If at first you
don’t succeed<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“T-t-try, try again,” assisted Gordon. Fudge muttered
something both unintelligible and uncomplimentary,
and Gordon turned to Dick: “How did you get
on with Mrs. Thingamabob at the Point, Dick?” he
asked. “What’s the kid like?”</p>

<p>“All right. The name is Townsend. They’re at
the hotel. The boy is thirteen and he’s—he’s a bit
spoiled, I guess. There’s an older brother, too, a fellow
about seventeen. He confided to me that I’d have
a beast of a time with the youngster. His name—the
brother’s—is Loring Townsend. Anybody know
him?”</p>

<p>There was no response, and Dick continued:</p>

<p>“He seemed rather a nice chap, big brother did. As
for the kid—his name is Harold, by the way<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Fancy names, what?” said Gordon. “Loring and
Harold.”</p>

<p>“No fancier than your own,” commented Fudge,
still a trifle disgruntled. “Gordon! Gee, that’s a sweet
name for a grown-up fellow!”</p>

<p>“Not as sweet as Fudge, though,” answered Gordon.</p>

<p>“That’s not my n-n-name!”</p>

<p>“There, you’re getting him excited again,” said
Lanny soothingly. “Move out of the moonlight,
Fudge. It’s affecting your disposition. What about
the kid, Dick? Is he the one you’re going to tutor?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he’s entered for Rifle Point in the Autumn,
and he’s way behind on two or three things. The
worst of it is that he doesn’t seem very enthusiastic
about catching up. I guess I’ll have my work cut out
for me. The big brother told me that I was to take
no nonsense from young Harold, and that he’d back
me up, but—I don’t know. I guess Mrs. Townsend
wouldn’t approve of harsh measures. She’s trying her
best to spoil the kid, I’d say. I’m to go over five mornings
a week, beginning Monday.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I don’t have to do it,” commented Gordon.
“I’ll bet the kid is a young terror, Dick.”</p>

<p>Dick smiled. “He is—something of the sort. But
I guess he and I will get on all right after a while.
And if he’s got it in him to learn, he will learn,” Dick
added grimly. “That is, unless his mother<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“She’s bound to,” said Lanny. “They all do. Inside
of a week she’ll be telling you that you’re working
her darling too hard.”</p>

<p>“How do you know so much about it?” challenged
Fudge. “Anyone would think you were a hundred
years old!”</p>

<p>Lanny laughed. “I’ve kept my eyes open, Fudge,
sweet child. Mothers are pretty fine institutions; no
fellow should be without one; but they are most of
them much too easy on us. And you know that as well
as I do.”</p>

<p>“Mine isn’t,” murmured Fudge regretfully. “She’s
worse than my father at making me do things!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you’re an exceptional case,” said Gordon
gently. “When a fellow shows criminal tendencies
like yours, Fudge<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Yes, writing stories at your age! You ought to
be ashamed!” Lanny spoke with deep severity. Fudge
only chuckled.</p>

<p>“Some day,” he announced gleefully, “I’m going to
write a story and put you fellows all into it. Then
you’ll wish you hadn’t been so fresh. The only thing
is”—and his voice fell disconsolately—“I don’t suppose,
if I told what I know about you, I could get it
published!”</p>

<p>“Deal gently with us, Fudge,” begged Dick humbly.
“Remember, we used to be friends. I must be
getting along, fellows. Coming over to-morrow,
Gordie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll drop around in the morning. We’ve got
to get busy and send out some challenges. Who can
we get to play with us, Lanny, besides Lesterville and,
maybe, Plymouth?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I think there are plenty of teams,
though, if we can find them.”</p>

<p>“They have a team at Logan,” said Fudge, “but I
guess they’re older than we are.”</p>

<p>“What do we care?” asked Gordon. “Logan’s a
good way off, though, and I suppose it would cost like
the dickens to get there.”</p>

<p>“Make them come over here,” suggested Lanny.</p>

<div align='center'>
<img alt='' id='i1' src='images/illus-054.jpg' />
<p style='width:349px'>“‘Good-night,’ responded Gordon and Fudge”</p>
</div>

<p>“Yes, but then they’d want their expenses guaranteed.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” observed Dick, “why couldn’t we
charge admission to some of the games after we got
started? I dare say quite a lot of folks would pay a
quarter to see a good game.”</p>

<p>“They might,” conceded Lanny. “We could try it,
anyway. If we could get, say, a hundred admissions,
we’d have twenty-five dollars, and then we could pay
the expenses of any team around here. That’s a bully
idea, Dick. As a manager you’re all to the good.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” replied Dick, setting his crutches under
his arms. “We’ll talk it over to-morrow. You
come over, too, Lanny; and Fudge if he is not in the
throes of literary composition.”</p>

<p>“I’ll walk around with you,” said Lanny. “It’s too
bully a night to go to bed, anyway. Good-night, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” responded Gordon and Fudge. “Good-night, Dick.”</p>

<p>They watched the two as long as they were in sight
in the white radiance of the moon, and then:</p>

<p>“They’re two of the finest fellows in the world,”
said Fudge warmly. “And wouldn’t Dick be a wonder
if he was like the rest of us, Gordie?”</p>

<p>“Y—yes,” replied Gordon thoughtfully, “only—sometimes
I think that maybe if Dick was like the rest
of us, Fudge, he might not be the splendid chap
he is.”</p>

<p>Fudge objected to that, but afterward, returning
home by way of the back fence, he thought it over.
“I suppose,” he told himself, as he paused on his porch
for a final look at the moon, “what Gordie means is
that tribulations ennoble our characters.” That struck
him as a fine phrase, and he made a mental note of it.
Still later, as he lay in bed with the moonlight illumining
his room, he began to plan a perfectly corking
story around the phrase, with Dick as the hero. Unfortunately,
perhaps, for American literature, sleep
claimed him before he had completed it.</p>

<h2 id='c5'>CHAPTER V<br/>DICK VISITS THE POINT</h2>

<p>On Wednesday the Clearfield Baseball Club reported
for practice. There was a full attendance,
with the exception of Tom Haley.
Gordon confined the hour’s work to fielding, however,
and Tom’s absence was not felt. Fudge had purchased
a brand-new High School uniform and Pete
Robey had been lucky enough to borrow one from a
boy who had played on the team several years before.
As the shirts and caps held only the letter “C,” there
was nothing misrepresentative about the gray uniforms.
Of course, the fact that the C was purple and
that the stockings were of the same royal hue might
lead one to mistake the team for the High School nine;
but Gordon had consulted the principal, Mr. Grayson,
in the matter, and Mr. Grayson had given it as his
opinion that, so long as they did not pretend to be the
High School team, there could be no harm in wearing
their school uniforms.</p>

<p>Most of the fellows had not played since the final
game with Springdale, nearly a month before, and
were consequently rather out of practice. Muscles
were stiff, and that first day’s work only produced soreness.
But by Saturday the fellows were pegging the
ball around with their old-time ginger and running
and sliding with their accustomed agility. Tom
pitched to the batters on Friday, and the result proved
that batting practice was far from being a waste of
time. Even Gordon, who had headed the batting list
that Spring, found that his eye was bad and that he
could connect with Tom’s easy offerings scarcely better
than the tail-enders.</p>

<p>Fudge plunged into the business with heart and soul,
determined to make himself not only a useful member
of the outfield but a regular Ty Cobb or Home-Run
Baker at the bat. I regret to have to state that
for some time Fudge’s fielding was not at all spectacular
and that he never—or at least never that summer—threatened
to dispute Mr. Cobb’s supremacy with the
stick. But they didn’t expect great things from Fudge;
and as time went on he developed a very clever judgment
in the matter of fly balls and even became able to
throw with some accuracy to the infield.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dick had entered into correspondence
with some half dozen baseball teams in not too distant
towns, and already a game had been scheduled
with Lesterville, who, to Dick’s surprise and satisfaction,
offered to pay Clearfield’s expenses if it would
visit Lesterville. Manager Lovering promptly agreed
and the date of the contest was fixed for the second
Saturday following the Rutter’s Point game. On Friday
morning Dick and Caspar Billings again met and
completed arrangements. Caspar, a boy of Dick’s
own age, took a great liking to the Clearfield manager,
and insisted on his staying to luncheon with him on
that occasion, and it was on the Billings’ veranda,
within a stone’s throw of the waves, that the two
talked it all over.</p>

<p>Caspar was a fine-looking youth, rather large but
well conditioned, with dark hair and eyes, a ready
smile, and a jovial laugh. He lived in New York, but
had been spending his summers at the Point for several
years. Dick met Caspar’s mother and two older
sisters at luncheon, but Mr. Billings was not present,
and Dick gathered that he remained in New York
save for an occasional week-end. When Caspar explained
that Dick was tutoring Harold Townsend, Mrs.
Billings shook her head pessimistically.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” she said, “you’ll find him rather difficult.
He isn’t exactly what I’d call a nice-dispositioned
boy.”</p>

<p>“Come, mother, don’t discourage Lovering at the
start,” laughed Caspar. “We all know that the kid’s
horribly spoiled, but then Lovering isn’t going to be a
governess to him!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to discourage him, dear, but I thought
it only right he should know that—well, if he isn’t very
successful, it won’t be altogether his fault. Mrs.
Townsend is a dear woman, but I can’t admire the
way she has brought up that boy.”</p>

<p>“His brother has already warned me,” replied Dick,
with a smile. “I’m prepared for the worst. So far,
Harold has behaved very well. He doesn’t like to
study much, but he hasn’t—well, lain down in the
shafts yet.”</p>

<p>“He will, though,” laughed Caspar. “And if you
don’t keep a tight rein he will bust the shafts! That
brother of his is a nice chap, though. By the way, he’s
going to play first base for us, Lovering.”</p>

<p>“Who is your pitcher?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“I—we aren’t quite sure. We expect it will be Mason,
but he hasn’t come yet. If he doesn’t show up
we’ll have to find some one else. You know Morris
Brent, don’t you? He’s on the team, too. Then
there’s Pink Northrop and Jim House and Gilbert
Chase and Charlie Leary and—let’s see; oh, yes, Billy
Houghton. And Mason, if he gets here in time. How
many’s that? Never mind. I dare say I’ve forgotten
one or two. I guess we’ll average a year or so older
than you chaps, but you have been playing together,
and I guess that will equalize things. That field over
behind the hotel isn’t the best in the world, but it’s not
bad in the infield.”</p>

<p>“What position do you play?” asked Dick, when
they were back on the veranda.</p>

<p>“Third usually. I’m not particular. I’m not much
of a player, but I get a lot of fun out of it. I’ve tried
two years running for the team at school and haven’t
made it yet.”</p>

<p>“What school do you go to?”</p>

<p>“St. George’s. We turn out some pretty fair ball
teams there. I’m going to try again next Spring.
It’s my last year, and if I don’t make it then I’m a
goner.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re going to college, though?”</p>

<p>“No; my father doesn’t want me to. Says he needs
me with him in the office. I don’t mind—very much.
Of course, I’d like to go; ’most every fellow I know at
school is going. Maybe father will change his mind
before Spring. What about you, Lovering?”</p>

<p>“College?” Dick shook his head. “I’d like it
mighty well, too, but it costs too much. Funny how
fellows who can go don’t care about it. There’s Morris
Brent. His father’s crazy to have him go to college.
He tells Morris he can have his pick of them all.
Morris doesn’t want to go a bit; and he won’t, I guess,
if he doesn’t brace up.”</p>

<p>“Exams, you mean?”</p>

<p>Dick nodded. “Morris is always in trouble with
his studies.”</p>

<p>“His father’s a bit of a Tartar, isn’t he?” asked
Caspar. “I’ve only met him once or twice, but he
seemed sort of cross-grained.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I know he and Morris are always
at outs about one thing or another. Just now, I hear,
it’s an automobile. Morris wants one, and his father
says he can’t have it. Do you know him very well?”</p>

<p>“Not very. We’ve seen each other quite a little for
several summers, but we aren’t awfully chummy. I
don’t quite<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>” Caspar paused, with a puzzled
frown. “If he’d forget that his father has a lot of
money, he’d get on better with fellows here. I like
his sister, though. She’s an awfully nice, jolly kid.
And his mother’s mighty nice, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so I’ve heard. I don’t know them. Well, I
must get along. We will be over here in time to begin
the game at three on Saturday, Billings. I’ll talk to
Gordon about the umpire, but I’m pretty sure the chap
you speak of will be satisfactory to us. Thanks for
being so kind. Will you say good-bye to your mother
and sisters, please?”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Caspar warmly. “Hope
you’ll come around often, Lovering. See you Wednesday,
anyway.” He watched Dick’s deft manipulation
of his crutches anxiously. Finally: “I say, it’s a long
walk to the trolley. Let me take you over, won’t you?
We have a sort of a horse and cart here, and it won’t
take a minute to hitch up.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks; I like to walk,” replied Dick, with a
smile. “Maybe you wouldn’t call it walking, though;
perhaps I ought to say that I like to ‘crutch.’”</p>

<p>“Call it what you like,” responded Caspar heartily,
“you certainly do it mighty well, Lovering!”</p>

<p>Dick reached the trolley station in ample time for
the two-forty-five car back to Clearfield, and on the
way his thoughts dwelt largely on Master Harold
Townsend. Master Harold was a good deal of a
problem. So far, as Dick had told Mrs. Billings, the
boy had behaved very decently, but Dick knew quite
well that it was principally because he was still in some
awe of his tutor. That awe would soon wear off, for
there wasn’t enough difference in the ages of the two
to allow Dick to keep the upper hand very long. Then,
as Dick realized, there’d be trouble. Unfortunately,
he could not, he felt, count on the boy’s mother to back
him up, for that lady was lamentably weak where her
youngest son was concerned. Of course, Dick might
keep on drawing his wages all summer and nothing
would be said, but he didn’t intend to do that unless he
was earning them. And it wasn’t going to be an easy
matter to earn them as soon as Harold got over his
present diffidence and the slight enthusiasm with which
Dick had managed to imbue him. The money meant
a good deal to Dick, and he hated to think of losing it,
but one thing was certain: As soon as he failed to
make progress with Harold he would quit. Perhaps
he would find another pupil, he reflected more hopefully,
although so far only Mrs. Townsend had replied
to his application.</p>

<p>Just then, his gaze wandering along the flying landscape,
he caught sight of a small blue runabout automobile
trying desperately to keep pace with the trolley
car. The road was a good three hundred yards away,
and it was not possible to make out with any certainty
the identity of the lone figure in the blue car, but Dick
was pretty sure that the daring driver was Morris
Brent. If so, he had, then, overruled his father in the
matter, thought Dick. It wasn’t like Mr. Brent to
change his mind, either. In any case, and whoever
was driving the runabout, that light vehicle was plunging
along the none too smooth road at a pace that
brought Dick’s heart into his mouth more than once
and attracted the concerned attention of all the occupants
of the trolley car. Several times, as it seemed,
the runabout narrowly avoided collision with the white
fence which ran beside the dirt road, and Dick was
heartily relieved when, presently, a team approached
from the direction of Clearfield, and the driver of the
automobile, recognizing the futility of trying to pass
at his present reckless speed, slowed down and was
lost to sight from the car.</p>

<p>Dick mentioned the incident to Gordon at practice
that afternoon, but Gordon was unable to say whether
Morris had bought the automobile he had spoken of.
“He said he was going to, though, whether his father
wanted him to or not. Said he had some money of his
own and that Stacey, the agent on Oak Street, would
wait for the rest. If his father finds it out, he will
be hopping mad, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take him long to find it out,” replied Dick
dryly. “At least two dozen persons saw him to-day.
Someone’s pretty sure to speak of it. The idiot was
driving as though he wanted to break his silly neck!”</p>

<p>“That’s the way Morris would drive,” said Gordon.
“By the way, there’s a meeting of the Athletic Committee
called for next Saturday night in Assembly Hall
to consider a new field. Will was telling me. He says
he doesn’t see how we’re going to get a field without
paying for it, and we haven’t any money to do that.”</p>

<p>“It’s tough luck,” replied Dick. “Have they any
field in sight?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. Will said something about a piece
of land on the way to the Point, near the picnic
ground. Do you know what he means?”</p>

<p>“No; but I guess there’s plenty of land there. I
don’t believe it’s very level. I suppose beggars mustn’t
be choosers, however.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s mighty mean of Mr. Brent to take that
field away from us!” said Gordon scowlingly.</p>

<p>“Did you tell him so the other day?” Dick asked innocently.</p>

<p>Gordon laughed. “No, I forgot to! Come on and
let’s get these fellows started. Tom, will you pitch at
the net for a while?”</p>

<p>“Shall I tell Billings it’s all right about the umpire,
Gordie?”</p>

<p>“Yes; we don’t care who umps as long as he knows
how. If they play us again, we’ll have the choice then.
Now then, fellows, get your batting eyes! Don’t be
too easy with us, Tom. Speed ’em over, old scout!”</p>

<h2 id='c6'>CHAPTER VI<br/>CLEARFIELD PLAYS THE POINT</h2>

<p>Clearfield boarded the two-fifteen trolley
car on Wednesday and set out for Rutter’s
Point in high spirits. They had intended taking
the two-o’clock car, but Harry Bryan and Fudge
had failed to arrive at the starting point on time.
Harry claimed business affairs as his reason for tardiness,
but Fudge’s excuse was both vague and involved,
and Gordon informed him that the next time he failed
to be on time he would be left behind. Fudge smiled
dreamily.</p>

<p>The team in their gray uniforms with purple stockings
presented a very natty appearance. To be sure,
some of the stockings were pretty well faded and several
of the suits were somewhat stained, but on the
whole the players passed muster very well. They took
possession of the first two seats on the car and had a
very happy and fairly noisy time of it. Dick and
Gordon got their heads together over the batting order
and rearranged it for the third time. When it was
finally fixed to their liking it was as follows: Bryan,
2b; Scott, 3b; Merrick, 1b; Wayland, l. f.; Tappen,
r. f.; Robey, ss.; White, c.; Shaw, c. f.; Haley, p.</p>

<p>“We’ll try it that way,” said Gordon, “and see how
it goes. Maybe we’d better put Jack after me, though.
What do you think?”</p>

<p>“We had it that way, and you thought we’d better
change it,” answered Dick patiently.</p>

<p>“I know, but—but I guess he ought to follow me,
Dick.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Dick, with a smile, “who’s manager
here?”</p>

<p>“You are,” replied Gordon, a trifle sheepishly.</p>

<p>“All right. I just wanted to know.”</p>

<p>“Then—you think<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“I think the batting order is going to stay just as it
is!”</p>

<p>They reached the field shortly after half-past two,
and found a handful of spectators from the hotel and
cottages already seated in the shade of the little row
of trees behind the third-base line. The Point team
was not in evidence, and Gordon quickly distributed
his players over the diamond and started warming up.
Five minutes later the rival team appeared by ones
and twos, and Caspar Billings sought Dick where he
was watching the performance of his charges. When
Gordon came in from first base, Dick introduced the
rival captains and they shook hands. Other introductions
followed, but several of the Point fellows were
already known to the Clearfield members. Clearfield
gave up the diamond to her opponents at ten minutes
to three, and watched their practice. The Point team
was not in agreement, it appeared, as to a uniform.
Every player wore togs of some sort, but at least a
half-dozen schools were represented, and there were
stockings of about every color in the solar spectrum in
evidence. The umpire was named Vokes, and was a
college man who was serving as a clerk at the hotel.
Gordon decided that while Mr. Vokes’ sympathies
might be with Rutter’s Point he was not the sort to
let them affect his decisions. Also, Gordon reflected,
unless he was very much mistaken, Vokes knew baseball
from A to Z. As it turned out, Gordon was not
mistaken, and Mr. Vokes’ umpiring was perhaps the
most perfect feature of that far from perfect contest.</p>

<p>Clearfield, as the visiting team, went to bat first.
Dick, who had been given the Point batting list by a
youth who was to score for the home team, was relieved
to find that Mason was not set down as a
pitcher. Dick didn’t know a thing about Mason, but
he somehow had got the impression that Mason was
something a bit unusual. Evidently he had not arrived
in time for to-day’s game. The pitcher whom
the Point presented was named Porter. He looked
capable and wore a Lawrenceville cap with what Dick
took to be the second team insignia over the visor.</p>

<p>The Point team averaged perhaps a year and a half
more than the visiting nine, and was almost entirely
composed of players from well-known preparatory
schools. As, however, they had never performed together
before as a team, save in one or two desultory
practice games with a nine made up of hotel employees,
Dick had hopes of taking their measure to-day.</p>

<p>Some seventy or eighty onlookers were gathered
together on the grass behind the third base line, prepared
to root for the Pointers, when Porter delivered
the first ball to Harry Bryan. It was a pretty hot afternoon,
for what breeze there was came from the landward
side of the sun-smitten field. Two settees had
been placed on the first-base side of the plate for the
accommodation of the visitors, and here Dick and the
others sat in the full glare of the afternoon sun, Dick
perspiring over his score book and the rest watching
interestedly the behavior of the rival pitcher. The
field was fairly level about the infield, but further out
it rolled a good deal and was covered with rough,
bunchy grass.</p>

<p>Porter disposed of Harry Bryan without trouble,
and Will Scott took his place at the plate. Will beat
out a slow grounder to shortstop and went to
second on Gordon’s bunt down third base line. But
Gordon was out at first and Curtis Wayland let the
third strike get by him.</p>

<p>Rutter’s Point led off with a clean two-base hit
by Caspar Billings and followed it with a neat sacrifice
bunt that placed the captain on third. But
he died there a few minutes later, for Tom Haley
struck out Morris Brent easily and made the next
man pop up a fly to Pete Robey.</p>

<p>The second inning passed without a score, but in
the first of the third, after Tom Haley had struck
out, Harry Bryan drove a long fly into right field
and reached second when the fielder misjudged it.
Will Scott walked and Gordon hit clean past third,
Harry scoring the first run and leaving third and
second occupied. Way went out, second to first.
Jack Tappen put himself in a hole and then emerged
brilliantly with a smash that was too hot for the
pitcher. Will scored and Jack reached first safely.
With Gordon on third, Jack tried a steal. To his surprise
the Point catcher slammed the ball down to shortstop
and Jack was caught a yard away from base.
Gordon scored too late.</p>

<p>But with a lead of two runs things looked bright
for Clearfield. The Point again failed to cross the
platter, although Loring Townsend got as far as
second. Tom’s shoots were too much for the home
team. Neither side scored in the fourth. When
the first half of the fifth began Pete Robey was up,
and Pete, contrary to expectations, delivered a scratch
hit and reached the first bag. Lanny flied out to left
fielder and Pete reached second ahead of the throw-in.
Fudge went out on strikes and, with Tom Haley
up, the inning seemed over. But Tom made his one
hit of the game, a Texas Leaguer that fell safely behind
first baseman, and Pete legged it for the plate
and arose from the dust triumphant with a tally. Tom
got to second on the throw to the plate, but Harry
was out, third baseman to first.</p>

<p>So far Clearfield had played a clean game in the
field, but in the last of the fifth luck deserted her. A
hard smash down the first base line put a runner on
second. A slow hit to Will Scott should have been
an easy out, but Will booted the ball and the runner
was safe. The next man went out on a foul to Gordon,
but the following batsman cracked a liner between
Peter and Harry and the Point scored its first
run. With a man on third, Lanny declined to throw
to second and the runner on first worked an easy steal.
Then a batsman found one of Tom’s straight ones
and sent it into short center. Fudge made a fine
running catch, but the best he could do was to field
the ball to Harry and Harry’s throw to the plate was
too late to keep the Point from tying the score. Tom
settled down then and struck out the next batter and
the inning was over, with the score three to two.</p>

<p>The spectators warmed up then and there was plenty
of noise during the rest of the game. The sixth inning
was uneventful, although both sides got men on
bases. The Point pitcher was by no means remarkable,
and, as Gordon complained, his deliveries would
have been easy for Clearfield had the latter’s batsmen
been in any sort of condition. As it was, though, they
found him puzzling when hits meant runs and by the
end of the sixth he had seven strike-outs to his credit.
It was during the last half of that inning that a small
youth detached himself from the group of spectators
across the field and walked around to the Clearfield
bench and seated himself beside Dick. He was a good-looking
youngster, as brown as a berry, with a pair of
big and rather impudent gray eyes.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said.</p>

<p>“Hello,” responded Dick, glancing up from his
score. “How are you to-day, Harold?”</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy,” replied that youth easily. “Keeping
score?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Dick, crediting Harry Bryan with
an assist and Gordon with a put-out and penciling
the mystic characters “2-1 1” in the square opposite
Pink Northrop’s name. “Enjoying the game, Harold?”</p>

<p>Harold Townsend yawned. “I guess so. We’re
going to beat you fellows.”</p>

<p>“Think so?” asked Dick amiably.</p>

<p>“Sure thing. Our pitcher’s just getting good now.
Bede Porter never begins to pitch till the middle of
the game. He will have you fellows eating out of
his hand pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s pitched a pretty good game so far.
Hello!” Dick was gazing in surprise at the boy beside
him. “What have you done to your hair?”</p>

<p>Harold grinned. “Had it clipped. Mother’s so
angry she can’t see straight. She said I wasn’t to,
but I went down to the barber shop this morning before
breakfast. Gee, it’s fine and cool!”</p>

<p>“Hardly the right thing to do, though, was it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’ll get over it. Other fellows have their
heads clipped in summer, don’t they?”</p>

<p>Dick evaded the question. “How are you getting
on with your lessons?” he asked. “Going to be all
ready for me Monday morning?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” replied Harold without enthusiasm.
“Who’s the fellow catching for your team, Lovering?”</p>

<p>“Lansing White.”</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s a good name for him, White. He’s
a regular tow-head, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Is he? He’s a fine chap, though.”</p>

<p>“He don’t catch as well as Billy Houghton. Look
at the way Gil Chase stole on him last inning. Say,
you keep score dandy, don’t you? Isn’t it hard?”</p>

<p>“Not very, when you’re used to it. Would you like
to learn how?”</p>

<p>“No, I can do it well enough. It’s too much trouble,
anyhow. I’d rather play. My brother’s the best
player on our team.”</p>

<p>“Better than Caspar Billings?” asked Dick idly.</p>

<p>“Aw, go on! He can’t play! Why, Loring’s been
first baseman on his school team for two years. He
could be captain if he wanted to.”</p>

<p>“That’s very nice,” said Dick. “Now you’d better
scoot along and make room for the fellows. That’s
three out. I’ll see you Monday, Harold.”</p>

<p>“All right. Don’t come if it’s too much trouble,”
replied the boy with a grin. “I shan’t mind.”</p>

<p>“That your pupil?” asked Lanny, sinking on to the
bench beside Dick. “Looks like a fresh kid.”</p>

<p>“He is, rather,” replied Dick dryly. “Will, you’d
better play further in. That fellow House has laid
three bunts down the base line and made them good
twice. You’re up, Jack. Pete on deck. Let’s have
a couple of runs this inning, fellows.”</p>

<h2 id='c7'>CHAPTER VII<br/>THE BLUE RUNABOUT</h2>

<p>But although Jack Tappen drove out a two-bagger
over shortstop’s head and Pete Robey
got safely to first on an error by the third
baseman, the next three players went out in order,
Lanny on a foul that was pulled down by third baseman,
Fudge on strikes and Tom Haley on a weak effort
to second baseman.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the valiant cheers of its supporters,
the Point went to work in its half of the seventh
in a very business-like way. Townsend beat out a
bunt in front of base, Morris Brent hit safely into
short left field, advancing Townsend, and Gil Chase
sent a hot one through the pitcher’s box which Tom
couldn’t handle. With the bases full, things looked bad
for Clearfield. Tom knocked down House’s drive,
however, held Townsend at third, and worked the first
out. Then Leary, after spoiling three good ones,
fouled out to Lanny, and Clearfield breathed easier.
But Pink Northrop, although a tail-ender on the batting
list, came through with a hit that brought shrieks
of delight from the Point sympathizers and sent two
runs across. Billy Houghton trickled a slow bunt
toward first and the man on third tried for the plate.
But Gordon, running in fast, got the ball to Lanny
ahead of the runner and the side was out.</p>

<p>“You’re up, Harry,” announced Dick. “There’s a
fine opening for a bright young man between third
and short. See what you can do.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try it, but I’m batting pretty punk,” replied
Harry doubtfully. “What’s the matter with a bunt,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing, Harry. Hit it out. Get to first
and try a hit-and-run with Will.”</p>

<p>But Harry’s effort was a weak grounder that
bounded nicely into shortstop’s hands and there was
one out. Gordon, behind first, looked worried as
Will faced the pitcher. But, “Pick out a good one,
Will,” he called cheerfully. “He hasn’t much on
it.”</p>

<p>Will, profiting by the advice, sought to select one
to his liking and Porter very soon found himself in
a hole. The umpire didn’t like Porter’s offerings any
better than Will and after six deliveries Will walked
to first.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” cried Jack Tappen, relieving
Gordon on the coaching line. “He’s all in! Whale it
out, Gordon! Here we go, fellows!”</p>

<p>Gordon swung viciously at the first ball across and
the third baseman stepped cautiously back. Then came
a wide one that Gordon disdained. The next was
likewise a ball by a narrow margin. At first Will was
dancing back and forth and Jack was coaching at the
top of his lungs, while from behind third Lanny was
offering his budget of advice and comment. Porter
wound up again, Will started for second and Gordon
swung his bat. There was a <i>crack</i> as ball and bat
met, and Will, nearing second, saw Lanny’s entreating
gestures and never paused in his stride.</p>

<p>Out in center field the ball was bounding along the
turf and Gordon was already rounding first. Luck
helped Clearfield then, for just as center fielder
slackened his pace to get the ball the latter struck
against a tuft of the coarse grass in front of him and
bounded erratically aside. At third Lanny waved Will
on to the plate. Gordon, pausing a few yards past
first, took up his running again while the center fielder
turned and raced back for the rolling ball. When he
reached it Gordon was sliding to second in a cloud of
dust and Will was halfway to the plate. The fielder,
Jim House, made a beautiful throw, but Will beat it,
and the best the catcher could do was to hold Gordon
on second.</p>

<p>On the Clearfield bench the purple-hosed players
cheered and cavorted, while on the shady side of the
diamond a strange silence held. Way tapped the base
impatiently with his favorite bat and Harry implored
him to hit it out. Porter looked nervous for the first
time.</p>

<p>“He’s up in the air!” shrieked Harry. “Wait for
your base, Way. You don’t have to hit it! He’ll
pass you! Here we go! Here we go! Here<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>Harry paused only because Way had picked out the
first ball offered him and had banged it across to shortstop.
Gordon scurried to third and Way raced toward
first. Shortstop got the ball on a low bound, cast a
hurried look toward third and pelted it across to first.
But the throw was poor and although first baseman
got it he dropped it the next instant and the umpire
spread his hands wide.</p>

<p>“Watch home!” implored the catcher. But Gordon
was taking no chances with only one out and contented
himself with dancing up the base line a few
yards to draw the throw. The ball went back to
pitcher and pitcher and catcher met and held a conference.
Gordon spoke to Lanny and Lanny nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we’ve got them guessing, Harry,” he
called across.</p>

<p>“Here’s where we break it up, fellows!” responded
Harry. “On your toes, Way! Here we go!”</p>

<p>Porter glanced over his infield, tugged at his cap,
hitched his trousers, studied the catcher’s signal and
wound up. But the throw was to first and Way was
nearly caught napping. Twice more Porter tried to
clear that base, and then, anticipating a steal, threw
out to the catcher. But Way hugged first and only
grinned, while the umpire announced “One ball!”
Then a curve went over the corner of the plate and
Jack Tappen had a strike on him. The Point infield
was playing close and Jack knew that a bunt would
not help any. He let the second strike go by, a deceptive
drop, and then came the signal from Harry.</p>

<p>“Make it be good, Jack!” called Harry. “Here we
go! Here we go!”</p>

<p>Porter wound up again and Way started for second.
It was now or never for Jack and desperately
he glued his eye to the oncoming sphere, swung and
felt the pleasant tingle that announced that he had hit
it! Then he was racing for the base. Shortstop
had the ball a dozen feet back of the base line. Second
baseman ran to cover that bag. Perhaps he thought
a throw to the plate would fail to head off the speeding
runner from third, or perhaps he had some idea
of starting a double play. At all events, Chase tossed
the ball quickly toward second. It reached there simultaneously
with second baseman and Way. Second
baseman made a grab for it and got it, but at
that instant Way, sliding into the bag feet-foremost,
collided with the defender of the sack and the ball
trickled away in the dust. Gordon slid across the
plate, Way was safe at second and Jack was grinning
from first!</p>

<p>That misadventure was the Point’s undoing. Porter
went to pieces then and there. Pete hit a liner
that sent in Way, put Jack on third and himself on
second; Lanny, enjoined to wait for his base, stood
idle while the pitcher slammed four balls past him,
and then, with the bases full, and one out, Fudge,
with the score two strikes and two balls, resisted the
temptation to swing and was presented with his base.
Jack was forced across for the fourth tally.</p>

<p>Tom, eager to add his mite to the slaughter, hit a
beautiful drive toward left field and the runners started
around. But Caspar Billings performed the impossible.
Although the ball was at least a yard over his
head, he knocked it down with his right, spoiling what
was intended for a two-bagger, and sped it to the
plate ten feet in front of Pete, who, with the possible
exception of Caspar himself, was the most surprised
youth on the field. Back flew the ball to third,
but Lanny had luck with him and somehow managed
to slide into the bag ahead of Caspar’s descending
arm.</p>

<p>Encouraged, Rutter’s Point set about getting the
third out, and Porter settled down to deceive Harry
Bryan. But Harry, realizing that in all probability this
would be his last time at bat, and seeing what a fine
opportunity was presented him to write his name on
the annals of fame, was cautious and watchful. Porter
worked a low ball over for a strike, followed it
with a ball wide of the plate, coaxed him with a slow
one that failed to entice Harry or please the umpire
and then tried to sneak a fast one across in the groove.
But Harry saw it coming, laid all his strength along
that slender piece of ash he held and swung! And
when the excitement was over three more runs had
been piled on to Clearfield’s score and Harry was
seated, breathless but happy, on third, having lined
out a two-base hit into deep center and taken third on
the throw to the plate. That ended it, however, for
Will Scott popped a foul into first baseman’s hands.</p>

<p>With the score ten to four against them the Rutter’s
Point team was discouraged and beaten. It tried
half-heartedly to get a man around in the last of the
eighth and managed to stop Clearfield in the first of
the ninth, although some poor base-running on the part
of the visitors did more than any efforts of the home
team to save the plate in that inning. And in the
last half of the ninth the Point actually got a runner
as far as third. But there he stayed while the next
two batsmen fell before Tom’s slants and a third
sent up a short fly that settled comfortably into Pete
Robey’s hands and brought the game to an end.</p>

<p>Clearfield cheered Rutter’s Point, in the intoxication
of the moment using the regular High School
slogan, and Rutter’s Point cheered Clearfield and bats
were gathered up and the two teams started off the
field. They came together at the corner of the hotel
and Caspar called to Dick: “We’d like to try you
again, Lovering, some time.” And Dick answered:
“Glad to play you, Billings. We’ll talk it over soon.”</p>

<p>Morris Brent laid a hand on Gordon’s arm and
pulled him aside. “Say, Gordon, I’ve got my car
here. Come on back with me, won’t you? I’ll get you
home quicker than the trolley will do it.”</p>

<p>“Why, much obliged,” murmured Gordon,
“but<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on! I want you to see how dandy it
runs.”</p>

<p>“I’m not insured,” laughed Gordon, trying to pull
away from the other’s detaining hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! I won’t dump you out. I’ll run as
slow as you like. Come on.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right,” agreed Gordon without enthusiasm.
“Oh, Dick! I’m going back with Morris. I’ll
see you this evening.”</p>

<p>Morris led the way toward the pier, where the
Clearfield road joined the shore avenue, and Gordon
saw the blue runabout standing at the side of the
road. It was a very attractive little car, in spite of
the layer of gray dust which sullied the shining varnish.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she a peach?” demanded Morris. “And go!
Say, I went nearly forty miles an hour in her the
other day!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Gordon dryly, “Dick saw you, I
guess. He said you were racing with the trolley.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks, not that time! I was only doing about
thirty then. I had to slow down for a team. You
ought to have seen me the other morning on the
Springdale road. That was going some, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Well, if you try any thirty mile stunt to-day I’ll
fall out the back of it,” warned Gordon.</p>

<p>“I won’t. Wait till I start it. All right. In you
get. Pretty comfortable seats, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Gordon as the runabout swung
around in the dusty road and headed toward Clearfield
at a moderate speed. “Does—does your father
know about it?”</p>

<p>Morris chuckled. “No, not yet. I don’t want him
to, but I suppose some busybody will tell him.”</p>

<p>“Bound to,” said Gordon. “Especially if you do
such spectacular stunts as you did the other day. Folks
on the trolley, Dick said, expected to see you go off
the road any minute.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! Folks who don’t drive autos always think
that. Why, you’re just as safe in this thing as you
are in the trolley. Safer, I guess. Remember when
the car jumped the track year before last and killed
six or seven people?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’ll take my chances with the trolley,” replied
Gordon. “There it goes now. I wonder if the
fellows caught it.”</p>

<p>“Sure. Anyway, we’ll soon see. I can catch that
trolley as though it was standing still!” Morris pulled
down his throttle and the little car bounded forward
with a deeper hum of its engine. Gordon grasped the
arm of the seat beside him.</p>

<p>“Never mind!” he exclaimed. “I don’t care whether
they did or not, Morris! Pull her down!”</p>

<p>Morris obeyed, laughing. “Shucks,” he said, “that
wasn’t fast. We were only going twenty-five or six
miles an hour.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” grumbled Gordon, relaxing
his grip.</p>

<p>Morris indicated the speedometer with his foot.
“That thing tells you,” he explained. “Watch the
long hand. We’re doing sixteen now. I’ll hit her up
a bit. There, see the hand move around? Twenty—twenty-two—twenty-four<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“That’ll do, thanks! And for the love of mud, Morris,
keep her away from this fence!”</p>

<p>“Why, there’s five feet there,” protested the driver.</p>

<p>“Y-yes, but the old thing wabbles so it gives me
heart failure!”</p>

<p>“You just think it does,” returned Morris. “I can
keep her as straight as an arrow if I want to.”</p>

<p>“Want to, then, will you?” laughed Gordon uneasily.
“And—and here’s another car coming, Morris.
Hadn’t you better slow down a little?”</p>

<p>“Say, you’re an awful baby,” commented the other.
But he lowered the speed of the car still further and,
to Gordon’s relief, hugged the fence pretty closely
while a big gray touring car shot by them in a cloud
of dust. Morris turned a speculative, admiring gaze
on it as it passed.</p>

<p>“Thirty-five easily, she’s making,” he said. “Some
day I’m going to have one like that. These little
cars are all right to knock about in, but they’re too
light to get much speed out of.”</p>

<p>“How fast do you want to run, anyway?” grumbled
Gordon. “Isn’t twenty miles an hour fast enough?”</p>

<p>“You wait till you run one and you’ll see,” laughed
Morris. “Why, twenty miles will seem like standing
still to you!”</p>

<p>“It’s fast enough for me,” sighed Gordon. “Besides,
this road is so rough that—<i>Morris!</i>”</p>

<p>But Gordon’s cry was too late. There was a bump,
a crash, the sound of splintering wood, and<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span></p>

<h2 id='c8'>CHAPTER VIII<br/>ACROSS THE GULLY</h2>

<p>Gordon raised himself on one aching elbow
and looked dazedly about him. Up the bank
a dozen feet away lay the blue runabout on
its side, one forward wheel—or the remains of it—thrust
through a broken panel of the white fence that
guarded that side of the road. A cloud of dust still
hovered above the car, proving to Gordon that the
accident had happened but the moment before. If it
was not for that he could well have imagined that
he had lain huddled up in a clump of bushes halfway
down the steep bank for some time. His head
was spinning wildly and he felt horribly jarred and
bruised. But a tentative effort to get to his feet,
while it was not successful because of dizziness,
showed that at least he had no limbs broken. A second
effort, made when the clouds had stopped revolving
overhead like a gigantic blue-and-white pin-wheel,
brought him staggering to his feet.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, it was not until he stood swaying
unsteadily on the bank that he remembered Morris,
or, rather, that he felt any concern for him. Anxiously
then he looked about on every side. But no
Morris was to be seen. Gordon called in a weak and
shaky voice. There was no reply. Summoning his
strength, Gordon crawled slowly up the side of the
declivity, pulling himself by bushes and grass-tufts
until at last he was clinging limply to the fence rail.
There he leaned for an instant and closed his eyes.
He felt very much as if he was going to faint, and
perhaps he would have had he not at that moment, just
as he seemed about to go off into a deliciously fearsome
black void, heard the sound of a low groan.</p>

<p>Gordon pulled himself erect, opened his eyes and
tried to look about, but the sunlight was frantically
hot and glaring and the dusty road and the helpless
hulk of the overturned auto danced fantastically
before him. It was a full minute before he dared
attempt to again lift his head and look. Even then
sight was uncertain. But he realized that the groans—he
heard them quite plainly now, low and monotonous—came
from the further side of the car. He
squirmed through the stout rails and stepped dizzily
out into the road. Then he saw Morris.</p>

<p>He lay half in and half out of the car, one arm
stretched from him in the dust and the other caught
between the spokes of the steering wheel. Evidently
the wheel had saved him from being thrown out as
Gordon had been, but the latter, gazing with horror
at the white face that seemed crushed against the
dirt of the highway, surmised that it would have been
better for Morris had he too been hurled over the
fence. The dreadful thought that Morris was killed
assailed Gordon, only to be banished by the comforting
knowledge that dead folks don’t groan.</p>

<p>Gordon cast despairing looks up and down the road.
Not a team or person was in sight. Then he knelt
by Morris and spoke to him. But only low, unconscious
moans answered him. Panic-stricken for an
instant, Gordon gazed helplessly, his wits quite deserting
him. Then common-sense whispered and he
drew a deep breath of relief and seized Morris under
the shoulders. Tug as he might, though, he could
not budge the limp body. Then he saw why. Morris
had evidently started to leap from the car and had
got his left leg over the side when the car struck.
Now that leg was imprisoned with the whole weight
of the runabout upon it. Again Gordon looked along
the highway for assistance, but, as before, the road
stretched in either direction empty and deserted. Off
toward town a cloud of dust hovered, but whether it
indicated an approaching vehicle or a farmer’s wagon
moving slowly toward Clearfield there was no knowing.
Gordon set his lips firmly, striving to close his
ears to Morris’ groans, and tried to think what to
do. Perhaps if he could find water he could bring
Morris back to consciousness, but what use to do that
so long as the boy was pinned there under the car?
No, the first thing to do was to set him free, and Gordon
strove to think of a way to do it. He didn’t believe
for an instant that he was capable of lifting that
car and at the same time pulling Morris’ leg from
beneath it. In fact, he doubted if he was strong
enough to raise the weight of it. To make certain,
however, he tried. It did move a little, he thought,
but there was no question of raising it. Then he recalled
seeing automobilists lifting their cars with jacks
to put on new tires. If Morris had a jack<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>!</p>

<p>In a moment he was struggling with the cover
over the box at the rear of the seat. It was jammed
at one corner and it took him a full minute to wrench
it open. When he finally did, however, the lifting
jack was the first thing he saw. It was a small contrivance,
scarcely a foot high, and Gordon viewed
it doubtfully as he hurried with it around to the side.
Morris’ leg was held down at the ankle by the edge
of the turning-board and there was barely space between
the ground and the side panel of the car in
which to slip the jack. But it went in finally and
Gordon began to work the handle. There was a heartening
click as the cogs slipped into place and a cracking
of frame and varnish as the car slowly rose. Bit
by bit it went and at last Gordon pulled the imprisoned
leg out. And not an instant too soon, for there
was a lurch, the jack toppled sideways and the car
settled back again in the dust, a forward wheel spinning
slowly around.</p>

<p>Gordon turned Morris over on his back, placed a
seat cushion, which had toppled out, under his head
and again viewed the road anxiously. In the distance
the dust cloud had disappeared and the road
was still empty. He groaned with disappointment
and exasperation. Usually a half-dozen vehicles
would have passed in the ten minutes that had elapsed.
To-day, because Morris’ life perhaps depended on getting
him to a doctor, not one appeared! Gordon
again thought of water and looked around him. Only
dry hillside met his gaze on one side and only the
equally dry gully separating road from trolley track
on the other. But sight of the track gave Gordon
an idea. The cars ran every quarter of an hour or
so and if he could somehow get Morris down the bank,
across the wide gully and up the slope on the other
side it would be only a matter of a few minutes to
town. But the distance was a good two hundred and
fifty yards, he calculated, and Morris was no light
burden. And, to increase his difficulties, he himself
was in poor shape to make the effort. There was
nothing else for it, however, and Gordon hurried to
the fence and viewed the descent. A little further
along was a place where the bank had at some time
loosened and fallen in a miniature landslide and toward
that spot Gordon was presently making his way.</p>

<p>He tried carrying Morris in his arms, but after the
first few yards he had to give up. Instead, he took
him by the wrists and dragged him as he might have
dragged a sack of potatoes. It was hard work getting
him through the fence, but easier when that
obstacle was negotiated, for the descent helped. At
the bottom of the bank it was necessary to worm in
and out between bushes, while briars caught at him
and tripped him as he toiled backward toward the
further side of the gully. Twice he stopped to regain
his breath and mop his streaming face. And
it was while he was taking his second rest that a
buzzing, humming sound came to him from the direction
of town, a sound that grew louder even while
he turned to look. Far down the track, visible here
for a half-mile, came one of the big trolleys, swaying
from side to side and eating up the rails in its rapid
flight. There was but one thing to do, and Gordon
did it.</p>

<p>Dropping Morris’ wrists, he set off at a run for
the track. Once he tripped and measured his length
in the briars, but he was up again in the instant, while,
almost at hand as it seemed, the buzzing and throbbing
of the rails sounded. When he finally reached
the foot of the bank it seemed that he had not enough
strength left to climb it. But climb it he did, somehow,
with toes digging into the loose gravel and hands
clutching at the infrequent tufts of grass or weeds.
And when he reached the top and the side of the
track the plunging car was almost up to him.</p>

<p>He knelt there on the edge of the embankment and
waved his arms, shouting at the top of his exhausted
lungs. A screech from the whistle sent its warning
and then the big car was hurtling past him, the motorman
casting a puzzled, indifferent glance as he
shot by and the few passengers turning inquiring
faces toward the boy crouched beside the track. Dust
enveloped him and a great despair crushed him, and
he did what was perhaps the one thing that could
have stopped the car. He crumpled up in a heap at
the ends of the ties and then rolled, slowly at first
and then gaining momentum as he went, down the
gravel slope into a clump of bushes at the bottom.</p>

<p>The conductor, who had leaned outboard at the
warning shriek of the whistle, had seen the boy and
had kept his eyes on him as the car had gone past.
“Some kid wants to get on,” he explained to a passenger
beside him on the rear platform, “but there’s
no stop here.” Then his hand flew to the bell-cord.
Boys didn’t crumple up like that and go rolling down
embankments for the fun of it! With a loud grinding
of brakes the big car came shivering to a stop a
hundred yards along the track. The conductor tugged
again at the cord and slowly the car crept backward.
By that time the passengers were on their feet and
the conductor was hanging over the steps. Then he
had dropped and was plunging down the embankment
in a cloud of dust and a cascade of loose gravel, the
passenger on the platform following more carefully.</p>

<p>Gordon was already struggling to his feet when
they reached him, and somehow he made them understand
that some thirty yards away lay the unconscious
form of Jonathan Brent’s son. After that events were
very hazy and confused to Gordon. Kindly hands
pulled and lifted him up the embankment and into
the car, where he subsided weakly on a seat. Voices
asked questions and he tried to answer them. Someone
caught sight of the overturned automobile and
there was much pointing and much exclaiming. And
then three men came toiling across the ground below
with Morris and others slid and stumbled down to
help them, and almost at once the big car was pounding
back the way it had come, its strident whistle
shrieking above the hum of the rails in an incessant
warning and alarm!</p>

<h2 id='c9'>CHAPTER IX<br/>MR. MERRICK BREAKS A PLATE</h2>

<p>That was perhaps the quickest trip a Rutter’s
Point car ever made, and almost before
Gordon realized that town had been reached,
and certainly before he had fully recovered from
his experiences, the big yellow-sided car was coming
to a stop at the foot of B Street, from where it was
but two short blocks to Brentwood. The prolonged
and frantic whistling had summoned a knot of curious
persons to the corner as the car trundled around
the curve and there were plenty of willing hands to
bear the still unconscious form the remaining distance.</p>

<p>Gordon, not a little faint and weak, followed slowly.
Someone had sped ahead and when the little throng
reached the house anxious faces were already at the
doorway. Gordon remained without and soon the
men who had carried Morris inside returned to linger
about the door and await the doctor’s verdict. The
latter reached the gate a minute later, and, leaping
from his buggy, hurried up the walk, his black bag
swinging briskly.</p>

<p>There was a long wait after that. The accident
was discussed in low voices by the small gathering
outside and Gordon was forced to go through his
story again. Presently he left the front steps and
wandered around to the side of the house. From an
upper window came the low mutter of voices. Near
at hand was a rustic seat, placed against the wall of
the screened porch, and on this Gordon subsided with
a big sigh of relief. Inside the house a telephone bell
rang shrilly. Footsteps hurried. The voices in the
room upstairs still came indistinctly through the open
window. It was pretty late, Gordon reflected, and he
ought to be at home. His father would be angry with
him if he was late for supper. But he didn’t want
to go until he had heard whether Morris was going
to get well. Meanwhile, it was fine and comfortable
in the corner of the rustic seat and he would just
close his eyes a minute<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span></p>

<p>Someone was shaking him gently and calling “Gordon!
Wake up!” He stretched and opened his eyes.
“Yes’m,” he muttered sleepily. But it couldn’t be
morning, for it was almost dark and—and where was
he? He sat up quickly then and gazed about him in
blank surprise until his roaming glance encountered
the smilingly concerned face of Louise Brent bending
above him. “Oh!” he said, recollection coming
to him.</p>

<p>“Have you been here all the time?” asked Louise.
“You poor boy!”</p>

<p>“I—I must have fallen asleep,” admitted Gordon
sheepishly. “How—how is he, Louise?”</p>

<p>The girl’s face went suddenly serious in the twilight.
“He’s pretty badly hurt,” she said. “One
leg is broken and he hurt his head horribly, Gordon.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“They think so. Seems to me it’s quite enough,
though.”</p>

<p>“Of course, only<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>” Gordon heaved a sigh of relief—“I
was afraid he was dying. He—he looked
so awfully!”</p>

<p>“Yes, didn’t he?” Louise shuddered. “He is still
unconscious, but Doctor Mayrick says he will get his
senses back in a little while. He must have had an
awful blow on his head. Would you mind telling me
just how it happened, Gordon, or are you too tired?”</p>

<p>He recounted the incidents of the unfortunate ride
rather uncertainly. Somehow, they had got pretty
much mixed up by now.</p>

<p>“But I think you were splendid,” said the girl
warmly. “To think of stopping the trolley car was
fine, Gordon. You must have been dreadfully scared
and—and everything. And wasn’t it a wonder you
weren’t hurt too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so. I guess it would have been
better if Morris had been thrown out of the car too.
It was the steering wheel that kept him in, I think.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you ever thought of lifting the
car up with the—that thing you spoke of,” she said
admiringly. “Goodness, I’d have been so frightened
I’d have just cried!”</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better be going home,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“Yes, it must be quite late. And you haven’t had
any supper, have you? I wish I’d found you here
before.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I want any,” he murmured. “I—I’m
mighty glad he isn’t hurt any worse. I’ll come
around to-morrow if you don’t mind and see how
he is.”</p>

<p>“Please do. Mama will want to see you, Gordon.”</p>

<p>“I suppose your father is pretty angry, isn’t he?”
asked Gordon.</p>

<p>“He’s too upset and anxious now to be angry,”
replied Louise. “But I suppose he will have something
to say to Morris later. I felt all the time that
he shouldn’t run that car. It was horrid of him to
get it without letting anyone know.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’s got his punishment,” replied
Gordon grimly. “A broken leg will keep him laid up a
long time. I’m awfully sorry for him. Good-night,
Louise.”</p>

<p>It seemed a terribly long distance to his home,
although it was in reality but two blocks. His father
was on the porch, reading under the electric light,
when Gordon reached the steps. Down went the
paper and Mr. Merrick viewed his son with cold
severity.</p>

<p>“Well, Gordon, where have you been?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Over to the Point, sir. I—we<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“I think I have told you fairly often that I do not
like you to be late for your meals?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” assented Gordon wearily.</p>

<p>“Exactly. It is now—hm—nearly eight o’clock. I
think you had better go up to your room. You don’t
deserve supper at this hour. And—hm—after this
kindly give a little consideration to my wishes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Gordon wanted to tell him what had
happened, but he was frightfully tired and the thought
of getting upstairs and into his bed was very alluring.
Mr. Merrick showed that the conversation
was at an end by again hiding his face behind the
newspaper and Gordon went indoors and quietly
climbed the stairs, rather hoping that his mother would
not hear him. But she did, and came out of her
room with the secrecy of a conspirator.</p>

<p>“Gordon, dear,” she whispered, “your father was
very angry and said you were to have no supper, but I
put a little something on a plate for you. It’s on your
bureau. You shouldn’t stay out like this, though,
dear. Your father doesn’t like it and—and it makes
me worried, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, I won’t again,” replied Gordon. “I—I’m
not very hungry, though. I’m going to bed.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you—don’t you feel well?” inquired Mrs.
Merrick anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, I’m all right. I just feel sort of tired.
Good-night.” He kissed her and went on up the second
flight. Half-way up, though, he paused and called
down in a hoarse whisper: “Thanks for the eats,
ma!”</p>

<p>In spite of his weariness, sleep didn’t come readily.
It was a hot, still night and, although his bed was
drawn close to the two windows that looked out into
the upper branches of the big elm, not much air penetrated
to his room. He lay for a while staring out
at the motionless leaves, intensely black in shadow
and vividly green where the light from the big arc
on the corner illumined them, reviewing the incidents
of the day. He was awfully glad that Morris wasn’t
dangerously hurt, grateful for his own escape from
injury and sorry that Morris would have to lie abed
for many weeks while his broken leg knit together
again. Finally he dozed off only to awake in a terror,
imagining that he was riding in an automobile that
was just about to plunge down a cliff so steep and
deep that the bottom was miles away! He awoke
shaking and muttering and it took him several seconds
to reassure himself and throw off the effects of
the nightmare. After that he tossed and turned until
he remembered the plate on the bureau. He got up
and brought it back to bed with him, and leaned on
one elbow and ate a little of the cold chicken and
bread-and-butter his mother had placed on it. But
he wasn’t really hungry and his appetite was soon satisfied.
He put the plate on the floor beside him and
settled down again. A clock downstairs struck nine
and a moment later the town hall clock sounded the
hour sonorously. Then the telephone in the first
floor hall rang sharply and he heard his father’s chair
scrape on the porch and his father’s feet across the
hall.</p>

<p>“Hello? Yes.... No.... What say?...”</p>

<p>Gordon must have dozed then, for the next thing
he knew someone was pushing open his bedroom door
cautiously and asking if he was awake.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Gordon.</p>

<p>Mr. Merrick closed the door and came over to the
bed. “Time you were asleep, son,” he said concernedly.
“Having trouble?”</p>

<p>“I—I’ve been asleep once, sir. Something wakened
me.”</p>

<p>“Hm. Er—I was just talking to Mr. Brent on the
telephone, Gordon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?”</p>

<p>“Hm. He told me about the accident, son.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Did he say how Morris was?”</p>

<p>“Doing very well, he said. Why didn’t you—hm—why
didn’t you tell me about it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. I was sort of tired, and<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Brent says you carried Morris almost half a mile
to the trolley, Gordon.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t nearly that far. And I didn’t carry
him. He was too heavy. I—I pulled him.”</p>

<p>“Well, the doctor says it’s a lucky thing you got
him home as quick as you did. Mr. Brent is—hm—very
grateful. He’s going to stop in the morning and
see you.”</p>

<p>“He needn’t be,” murmured Gordon. “It wasn’t
anything.”</p>

<p>“Hm. You can tell me about it in the morning. I-hm—I’m
sorry I was so short with you, son. If
you’d explained<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I ought to have. It—it’s all right, dad.”</p>

<p>“Well, but—if you’re hungry, Gordon<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“I’m not, sir. I—no, sir, I’m not.”</p>

<p>“If you are I guess you and I can forage around
and find something. Sure you wouldn’t like a little
bite?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Well—hm<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>” Mr. Merrick laid a hand on Gordon’s
arm and pressed it. “Sorry I scolded, son. I—we—we’re
proud of you, boy.”</p>

<p>Gordon didn’t answer. It was rather embarrassing
and he was glad of the darkness.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Gordon.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Merrick turned away, there was a sound of
cracking and crunching china and an exclamation.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” asked Mr. Merrick in surprise, peering
down at the floor.</p>

<p>“It—it’s a plate, sir. Mother—that is<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Hm,” said Mr. Merrick, and then again “Hm!”
He pushed the broken fragments under the bed. “I—hm—I
can understand that you aren’t very hungry,”
he said dryly. “Evidently your mother—hm—well,
good-night, Gordie.”</p>

<p>The door closed. Gordon smiled at the black and
green foliage beyond the window. It was all right
about that lunch. If it wasn’t his father would never
have called him Gordie.</p>

<h2 id='c10'>CHAPTER X<br/>GORDON BEARS A MESSAGE</h2>

<p>Gordon was up at seven the next morning,
having had, as he reckoned, a good nine
hours and more of sleep. At breakfast he
told again the story of the accident, this time to an
interested audience of three. The third was Fudge,
who, since almost an hour before, had been hanging
around waiting for Gordon’s appearance, and who
now was seated at table with a cup of coffee and one
of Mrs. Merrick’s graham muffins in front of him.
Fudge acknowledged that he had rather skimped his
breakfast. Mr. Merrick mildly censured Gordon for
accepting Morris Brent’s invitation to ride, but it was
evident that he was too proud of Gordon’s part in the
affair to be severe. Fudge was anxious to know what
had become of the runabout and Gordon replied that
so far as he knew it was just where they had left it.</p>

<p>“I guess,” he said, “it’s pretty badly smashed up.
I know one wheel has about all the spokes out of it,
and I think the axle is busted. Still, I dare say it can
be mended.”</p>

<p>“B-b-bet you Morris will never run it again,
though,” said Fudge. “Guess it’s a good chance for
someone to buy an auto cheap. Wish I could!”</p>

<p>“Why, William!” murmured Mrs. Merrick. “The
idea!”</p>

<p>“Oh, a fellow doesn’t have to run it the way Morris
did,” replied Fudge knowingly. “Tim Turner’s father
has had a car for two years and he’s never had an
accident yet.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you see Mr. Brent?” suggested Gordon.
“I dare say he will let you have it for almost
nothing.”</p>

<p>Fudge thrust a hand in a pocket and gravely counted
the change he drew out. “If he’ll let me have it for
sixty-three cents I’ll take it,” he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Merrick pushed back his chair. “If I ever hear
of either of you riding in an automobile without permission
I’ll see that you get what you deserve,” he
said grimly.</p>

<p>Fudge grinned. “You’d have to catch me first,”
he said.</p>

<p>Gordon announced his intention of running over to
see Dick and his father reminded him that Mr. Brent
was going to call. Gordon replied evasively that he
guessed Mr. Brent had changed his mind. He
secretly hoped that he had. But when, after Mr. Merrick’s
departure for his office, Gordon wheeled his
bicycle down the steps he saw Mr. Brent coming along
the street, his ivory-topped walking-stick thumping the
pavement briskly. Escape was impossible and so
Gordon leaned his wheel against the gate post
and waited. Fudge melted into the background.
Mr. Brent was about the only person Fudge was in
awe of.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy,” greeted Mr. Brent, “you got off
lucky.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’m awfully sorry about Morris. How
is he?”</p>

<p>“Better than he deserves,” replied Mr. Brent with
a snap of his jaws. “The doctor tells me it will be
six weeks or more before he will be on his feet again.
I suppose he was running the thing like mad, wasn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, he was going quite slowly. I don’t know
just how it happened, Mr. Brent. I think there must
have been a bad place in the road.”</p>

<p>“Of course it wasn’t his fault,” said the other dryly.
“Well, it was a merciful thing he had you with him,
my boy. His mother and I are very grateful to you,
Merrick. You did a very plucky thing.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t anything,” muttered Gordon, looking
longingly at his wheel. Perhaps Mr. Brent saw that
he was more than willing to avoid further expressions
of gratitude, for he smiled and said:</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all. I wanted to see you and thank
you. And as I told your father last night I’m ready
and anxious to prove my gratitude to you. If there’s
anything I can do, Merrick, you call on me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir, but I guess there isn’t anything.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps some day there will be. When that time
comes don’t forget what I say, Merrick. I wish you’d
stop in at the house to-day or to-morrow and see Mrs.
Brent. She wants to see you, my boy. And after
Morris gets where he can talk to folks I’d like you to
pay him a visit too. He doesn’t deserve it, but—well,
I guess he’s in for a long, hard siege of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I will. I—I was going to call to-day and
ask after him, but now that I know how he is<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Better go just the same. My wife is anxious to
tell you how she feels about it, Merrick. She can do
it better than I can, too. Your father at home?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, he’s gone down town.”</p>

<p>“That’s where I ought to be. I waited around for
the doctor to call. By the way, Merrick, there’s something
you can do for me if you will. See this man
Stacey and get him to take that automobile away
from there. If I talk to him I’ll fly off the handle
and tell him what I think of him. I don’t care what
he does with the thing. He may burn it up or fix it
up or anything he likes, but you tell him from me that
he will never get another cent in payment. Will you
do that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I’ll see him right away. I guess the car
will be worth quite a good deal after it’s fixed up. I
mean, sir, I don’t think Mr. Stacey will be out much.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if he is,” replied Mr. Brent grimly.
“Morris tells me he paid three hundred and fifty
dollars and owes about two hundred more. He
will never get it. You tell him so. If he wants to
sue, let him. I wish he would!” Mr. Brent flicked
angrily with his cane at a spray of leaves that peeked
through the fence. “Well, I’ll be grateful if you’ll
attend to that for me, Merrick. Good morning.”</p>

<p>After Mr. Brent had gone Gordon summoned Fudge
with a whistle and that youth sauntered around from
the back yard. “I guess Stacey will be mad,” he commented
when Gordon had told him of the commission
he had accepted. “I’ll go along with you. I like a
scrap.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t going to be any scrap,” said Gordon.
“I’ll just tell him what Mr. Brent says and come
away.”</p>

<p>“All right. Wait till I get my wheel.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stacey’s place of business was on Oak Street,
a smart shop with two big plate-glass windows behind
which were displayed shining new automobiles. The
proprietor was a small man under thirty who affected
brilliant neckties and a jovial smile. But the smile
faded when Gordon delivered his message. Mr. Stacey
looked angry and ugly.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” he demanded truculently. “Old Jonathan
Brent said that, did he? Well, you tell him I
hold Morris’ note for two hundred and thirty-five dollars
and I mean to collect it. Why, that car’s no good
to me, son! What would I do with it? It isn’t mine,
anyway. I sold it fairly and squarely. If he wants
me to fetch it in and have it repaired I’ll do it and
charge him only what it costs, but as to taking it back
and calling quits—nothing doing, son. You tell him
that, see?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t my affair,” replied Gordon calmly. “I’ve
only told you what Mr. Brent asked me to. Why
don’t you talk to him about it?”</p>

<p>“Because I haven’t any dealings with him. I sold
that car to his son. If he wants to talk to me let him
come here or call me up on the telephone. It’s nothing
to me. I’ve got Morris Brent’s note<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“It isn’t worth anything,” piped up Fudge, who
found proceedings dull. “He isn’t old enough to give
a note.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see whether he’s old enough,” was the answer.
“I’ll go to court with it if it isn’t paid prompt.
Get me?”</p>

<p>“Sure. But Jonathan Brent’s a bad man to fight,
I guess,” said Fudge with a shake of his head. “I
wouldn’t want to do it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you wouldn’t.” Mr. Stacey had to smile
in spite of himself. “But I would—if I had to. I’m
not in this business for my health, son. You tell Mr.
Brent that if he wants me to haul that car in and repair
it I’ll do it, but I won’t take it back.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Gordon. “Seems to me,
though, you could fix it up for a few dollars and have
a perfectly good car.”</p>

<p>“There’s no market here for second-hand cars,” replied
the dealer shortly. “Tell you what I will do,
though. I’ll fix that car up as good as new as cheap
as it can be done and take it on sale. Maybe I’d find
a buyer for it.”</p>

<p>“You mean you’ll let Morris off on the balance he
owes?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I don’t mean anything of the sort! I mean
that he’s to pay what he owes when it comes due. If
I can sell the machine he’ll get what it fetches, less my
commission of twenty per cent. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell Mr. Brent what you say,” agreed
Gordon. “But I don’t believe he will be willing to have
it that way.”</p>

<p>“There’s no other way he can have it,” snarled Mr.
Stacey. “He may have a heap of money and own this
town, but he don’t own me! And he can’t cheat me
out of what belongs to me, either! And you can
tell him so! You tell him that if that two-thirty-five
isn’t paid by the tenth of October I’ll
sue for it.”</p>

<p>“Think of him suing Mr. Brent!” chuckled Fudge as
they went out.</p>

<p>“I guess he’d have a pretty good case, though,” said
Gordon. “Of course Morris <i>does</i> owe that money to
him.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, Morris’ note isn’t worth a cent.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not; I don’t know about that; but he’s
morally liable, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. Going to tell Mr. Brent now, Gordie?”</p>

<p>Gordon shook his head. “Not—not right away. I
think I’ll see Dick first. I told him I’d be over last
night.”</p>

<p>Fudge chuckled again. “You’re scared,” he said.
“I’d be, too. Tell you what, Gordie; tell him over
the ’phone, why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of letting you tell him, Fudge.”</p>

<p>“Me! Gee, I wouldn’t d-d-do it if he g-g-gave me
the car!”</p>

<p>They found Dick on the porch. “Hail to the Hero!”
he declaimed.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“Modesty is very becoming,” pursued Dick. “Hello,
Fudge. I’m glad to see you in such distinguished society.
Sit down, Gordie, and tell me about it. First,
though, how’s Morris getting on? Lanny told me that
he was pretty well broken to pieces.”</p>

<p>“He’s got a busted leg. Broken in two places.
That’s all. He was unconscious when they brought
him home, but he’s all right that way now. There
isn’t much to tell. We were coming along that stretch
where the white fence is and<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>Gordon went through with it again, Fudge interpolating
details where Gordon failed to do full justice
to the narrative. Afterward Gordon told about his
visit to the automobile agent. “I don’t know what
to do,” he ended. “I hate to tell Mr. Brent what
that fellow said, Dick.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why. It isn’t your fault. Besides,
Mr. Brent is in the wrong, anyway. It’s Morris’
duty to pay what he owes. The dealer isn’t supposed
to find out before he makes a sale whether the buyer’s
relatives want him to own a car!”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well,” grumbled Gordon, “but he
will be as mad as a March hare. I don’t see why he
got me to do it for him, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Because you’ve made a hit with him,” laughed
Dick. “I believe if you asked for it you could get
a yearly pass over the trolley line. And speaking of
trolleys reminds me that I’ve got to hustle over to
the Point and get busy with young Mr. Townsend.
What time is it?”</p>

<p>It was almost ten, and Dick seized his crutches and
swung himself hurriedly into the house to reappear
a minute later ready for the journey. Gordon and
Fudge walked to the corner with him.</p>

<p>“How about another game with those fellows,
Dick?” asked Gordon. “Are you going to see Billings
to-day?”</p>

<p>“If you want me to. There’s time enough, though,
I guess. We’ve got a game with Lesterville the day
after to-morrow, as you perhaps recall.”</p>

<p>“I know, but I was thinking we might get the
Pointers to come over and play us a week from Saturday.
You might see what Billings thinks about it.”</p>

<p>“All right. If I can find him I’ll ask. By the way,
he’ll have to find someone to take Morris’ place, won’t
he? Guess, though, it won’t be hard to do. Here
comes my car. See you later, fellows.”</p>

<p>Gordon and Fudge mounted their wheels again
when the trolley had rolled off and pedaled leisurely
along Sawyer Street.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” observed Fudge, “that Dick hasn’t got
that automobile, Gordie. It would save him a lot of
hard work, wouldn’t it? Say, someone may run off
with it if it stays out there on the road much longer.
Bet you half of it’s gone already!”</p>

<p>There was no reply from Gordon, who was riding
slowly along with his gaze fixed intently on his handle-bar.</p>

<p>“You ought to have hidden it behind a tree or something
before you came away, Gordie.”</p>

<p>“Eh? Hidden what?”</p>

<p>“The automobile, of course. Say, what did you
think I was talking about, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I guess I didn’t hear you,” replied Gordon apologetically.
“I—I was thinking.”</p>

<p>“Some day you’ll be doing that and get run down
by a trolley car,” commented Fudge crushingly.
“What were you thinking about?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much,” answered Gordon. “Want to play
some tennis?”</p>

<p>“My racket’s busted. I can borrow Lanny’s,
though. But I guess it’s too hot for tennis, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe. I suppose, anyway, I’d ought to see Mr.
Brent and tell him what that fellow said. There’s
no use putting it off. Will you come with me?”</p>

<p>“Not to speak of! I’d do most anything for you,
Gordie, but not that!”</p>

<p>“Well, ride down town with me. You needn’t
go in.”</p>

<p>“That’s fair. And I’ll try to catch you when he
drops you out the window. Come on.”</p>

<h2 id='c11'>CHAPTER XI<br/>FUDGE SCENTS A SECRET</h2>

<p>Mr. Brent was not in. The clerk, recognizing
Gordon as the youth who had called
previously and been admitted, explained, in
answer to his look of perplexity, that Mr. Brent had
been suddenly called to New York and would be
gone at least overnight.</p>

<p>“He didn’t leave any message for me, did he?”
asked the boy.</p>

<p>“No. He went away hurriedly. If it’s very important,
you can reach him in New York by telephone
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Gordon departed, shaking his head. On the sidewalk
he was presently joined by Fudge, who came out
of Castle’s drug store, a few doors away, with a suspicious
moistness about the mouth.</p>

<p>“You’re soon back,” he said. “Did he throw you
out?”</p>

<p>“He’s away. Gone to New York. Now what’ll I
do?”</p>

<p>“Do nothing. That’s easy. I should think you’d
be tickled to death.”</p>

<p>“But that automobile can’t stay out there on the
road forever, Fudge. Someone will steal it or pull it
to pieces or something. I guess I’ll go over to the
Brents’ and see what Louise thinks we’d better do.”</p>

<p>“Huh! What’s a girl know about it?” demanded
Fudge. “Say, I had a soda. Want one?”</p>

<p>Gordon shook his head at first but finally allowed
himself to be conducted to the front of the long white
marble counter. A nice cold raspberry phosphate is
an awfully good thing to soothe the mind, and Gordon
felt more cheerful when he emerged. Fudge, who
had followed his original root beer with a pineapple
phosphate, confided to Gordon on the way home that
he believed he’d apply at Castle’s for a job at the
soda fountain.</p>

<p>“You see,” he explained, “I never had enough soda
yet, and if I worked there I’ll bet I’d have a dandy
time!”</p>

<p>Gordon postponed his call at Brentwood until after
dinner and in the meanwhile presented his problem to
his father. Mr. Merrick’s advice was caution. He
thought Gordon had best let the automobile alone unless
he obtained authority from Mr. Brent or perhaps
Mrs. Brent to rescue it. When he reached Brentwood
he asked for Louise and that young lady soon
joined him. Morris, she reported, was very comfortable,
considering the fact that his left leg was in
a cast, but the doctor didn’t want him to see anyone
quite yet. Gordon was secretly relieved, for he was
afraid he wouldn’t know just how to behave or just
what to say to an invalid. Louise led the way to
the porch and then disappeared in search of her
mother. When that lady appeared Gordon had to
listen to many nice things and many expressions of
gratitude, all of which embarrassed him horribly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent was a short, comfortably stout lady with
soft, quiet manners and a voice to match. Gordon
liked her immensely, but just now he found himself
wishing that he might have escaped her. It was Louise
who, noting his unhappiness, finally came to his
rescue.</p>

<p>“There, mama, you’re embarrassing Gordon awfully.
I’m sure he doesn’t want to be thanked any
more. Besides, he didn’t come to make a social call;
he’s here on important business. He told me so.”</p>

<p>Gordon explained the difficulty about the abandoned
automobile and asked them what he had better do.
“You see,” he pointed out, “Mr. Stacey won’t go after
it unless someone tells him to. I was thinking that
perhaps the best thing would be to have one of the
liverymen bring it back and keep it until Mr. Brent decides
about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know what to say,” replied Mrs.
Brent. “If Mr. Brent says he won’t pay the man the
rest of the money, why, he won’t, and that’s all there
is to that. But, of course, the automobile can’t stay
on the road. I suppose, Louise, we oughtn’t to worry
Morris with it just yet.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, no! What does it matter what happens
to the horrid old thing, anyway, mama? Let someone
bring it into town and keep it. I’m sure Morris will
never want to see it again, even if papa is willing;
and of course he won’t be.”</p>

<p>“Then if Gordon will see to it<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, I will. I’ll get Stewart to go after it. I
guess he can pull it if he puts a timber under the
broken wheel. There wouldn’t be room in your stable
for it, would there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there would,” replied Louise. “There’s lots
of room in the carriage-house. Tell Stewart to bring
it here, Gordon.”</p>

<p>“All right. That would be the best thing, I guess.
Stewart would probably charge storage for it if he
kept it at his stable. I suppose he will want quite a
little money to haul it in, too.”</p>

<p>“Tell him to charge it to papa, Gordon. Do you
mind attending to it? It’s awfully nice of you to take
so much trouble for us. You’ll begin to think we’re
a pretty bothersome family, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind at all. I’m glad to, Louise. I wish
you’d remember me to Morris, please. I—I’ll call and
see him some time after he’s able to have visitors. Is
there anything I can do for him, Mrs. Brent?”</p>

<p>“I think not, Gordon. You’ve done so much already<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t have done any less,” murmured Gordon
hurriedly, fearing that Mrs. Brent was about to
express her gratitude again. “Folks—folks made more
of it than it—really amounted to. I guess I’ll go
and see Stewart. I hope Morris will get along finely
and—and everything.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” he said, after he had bade good-bye
to Mrs. Brent, “you won’t get over to the Point for
some time, Louise.”</p>

<p>“No, not for a month, probably. I don’t mind a
great deal. The main thing is to get Morris well
again. It’s going to be terribly dull and stupid for
him, Gordon.”</p>

<p>“Fierce!” They had paused at the gate. “If there’s
anything I can do, or anything any of us can do,
Louise<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Not now, but you can do a lot later,” she replied
smilingly. “You can come and see him and cheer
him up in a day or two. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Of course! Glad to! And I’ll bring the other
fellows, too.”</p>

<p>“I guess there aren’t very many others, are there?”</p>

<p>“Many others?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Many others who would care to come, I mean.
Morris doesn’t seem to have very many boy friends,
does he?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know. I guess every fellow likes
Morris<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Fibber! Never mind, though. You come when
you can, Gordon. Good-bye. I’ll tell Ryan to get a
place ready for the automobile.”</p>

<p>His way to Stewart’s stable led him past Lanny’s
house and he slowed down as he reached the gate
and whistled. Lanny appeared from around the
house with a bicycle chain dangling in his hand.</p>

<p>“Come on over to Stewart’s stable with me,” commanded
Gordon.</p>

<p>“Can’t.” Lanny exhibited the chain. “Chain’s
busted. I’ve been trying to fix it, but I think I’ll have
to take it to the shop.”</p>

<p>“Bring it along, then, and we’ll walk. I’ll stick
my wheel back of the fence here. I’ve got something
I want to talk to you about.”</p>

<p>“All right. Wait till I get some of this dirt off
my hands. It won’t take a minute.” As a matter of
fact, it took five, and Gordon was established comfortably
on the horse-block in front of the gate when
Lanny returned. Together they went on along B
Street and turned into River Street, talking very earnestly
all the way and more than once pausing stock-still
on the sidewalk. Whatever the subject of conversation
was, it was easy to see that Lanny was both
interested and enthusiastic, and at last, just before
their halting progress landed them outside the livery
stable, Lanny clapped a hand on Gordon’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“It’s a peach of a scheme!” he declared. “Does
he know anything about it?”</p>

<p>Gordon shook his head. “I just thought of it awhile
ago, after I’d seen him. I don’t think we’d better say
anything to him about it, Lanny, because he’d probably
refuse.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. The best way is to go ahead and do it—and
tell him afterward.” Lanny chuckled. “The
other fellows will have to know, though.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we’ll make them promise not to talk.
Gee, if I don’t hurry that automobile will stay out
another night, I guess!”</p>

<p>But fortunately Mr. Stewart had a truck and horses
that could be at once dispatched on the errand and the
two boys waited while the expedition made ready. Mr.
Stewart himself, a good-natured little red-faced
Scotchman, proposed to accompany the truck and personally
superintend the project. Afterward Gordon
went with Lanny to the bicycle repair shop and waited
while a new link was put in the broken chain. Later
in the afternoon they mounted their wheels and, with
Fudge, who had joined them meanwhile, rode over
to the back entrance of Brentwood and awaited the
arrival of the automobile. It came about half-past
five and was rolled into a corner of the big carriage-house.
Then Gordon and Lanny and Fudge took stock
of injuries. One wheel was smashed and the front
axle was bent. It didn’t require an expert to determine
that much. For the rest, barring a broken lantern
and bent fenders and a dent in the radiator, the car
was as good as new so far as they could see.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew enough about cars to try it and see
if the engine is all right,” said Gordon. “But I don’t
see how anything can be wrong there, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, I guess the wheels will go around same as before,”
said Lanny. “How much do you suppose it
will cost to fix it up?”</p>

<p>Gordon shook his head. “Maybe thirty dollars,”
he said finally. “What do you think?”</p>

<p>“Bet it will be nearer a hundred,” said Fudge. “Repairs
on automobiles cost like anything.”</p>

<p>“Fudge knows,” remarked Lanny. “His repair bills
are something frightful, aren’t they, Fudge? Why, he
was saying just the other day, Gordie, that he had half
a mind to sell two or three of his cars!”</p>

<p>“Th-that’s all right,” sputtered Fudge. “I’ve heard
Mr. T-T-Turner say th-th-that<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Of course you have,” agreed Gordon soothingly.
“By the way, Lanny, heard the latest? Fudge is going
to get a job with Castle at the soda fountain.”</p>

<p>“That s-s-s-s-so?” laughed Lanny.</p>

<p>“Yes. Can’t you see Fudge, with a white apron on,
leaning across the counter asking, ‘What kind of s-s-s-s-soda
will you have, Miss?’”</p>

<p>“‘S-s-s-sarsparilla, please,’” responded Lanny.</p>

<p>“‘S-S-So s-s-s-sorry, but we’re all out of s-s-s-sarsparilla.
We’ve got s-s-s-some nice ch-ch-ch-ch-chocolate,
though.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up,” said Fudge, with a grin. “If you fellows
come around there I’ll p-p-poison you!”</p>

<p>“Well, come on, fellows, it’s supper time,” said
Lanny. “Don’t you take that car out and go ‘joy
riding,’ Mr. Ryan.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” growled the Brent coachman, who had
viewed the proceedings with deep pessimism. “I
wouldn’t touch the thing for a hundred dollars. How
do I know it won’t be blowin’ me up some fine
night?”</p>

<p>“It won’t if you treat it kindly,” Fudge assured
him. “Give it plenty of oats and hay, Mr. Ryan, and
a drink of gasoline now and then and it’ll be as quiet
as a lamb.”</p>

<p>They left the coachman muttering over the harness
he was cleaning and got on their wheels. “Who will
you get to look at it?” asked Lanny as they rolled
homeward.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Not Stacey, anyway. Of course I’ll
have to talk with Morris first, and Mr. Brent too, I
guess. And maybe it won’t come to anything.”</p>

<p>“What won’t?” asked Fudge suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Never you mind, son. It’s something that doesn’t
concern little boys.”</p>

<p>“Go on and tell me,” begged Fudge. “Is it a secret?”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be if you knew it,” answered Gordon
unkindly.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know when I ever blabbed anything,”
exclaimed Fudge indignantly. “Didn’t I know all
about Charlie Matthews a whole week before anyone
else did? And didn’t I<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Well, we may tell you some time,” teased Gordon.
“What do you think, Lanny?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. It would cost money to advertise it in
the paper, and so<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, you make me tired,” growled Fudge. “I don’t
want to know it anyway. ’Tain’t anything, I’ll bet!”</p>

<p>“Not a thing, Fudge,” agreed Lanny.</p>

<p>“Then what you so—so mysterious about?” Fudge
demanded.</p>

<p>“To arouse your curiosity, Fudge. Good-night, Gordie.
Maybe you’d better tell him before he busts up.
Good-night, Fudge. Say, we play Lesterville Saturday,
don’t we?”</p>

<p>“You bet! And don’t forget practice again to-morrow.
We want to beat those fellows.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got a perfect record so far,” laughed
Lanny. “Our percentage is one thousand. Played
one, won one, lost none. Are the Pointers going to
play us again?”</p>

<p>“Sure! I told Dick to see Caspar Billings to-day
if he had a chance and see if they’d come over here
a week from Saturday.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. Bet you, though, they lick us next
time. So long.”</p>

<p>Lanny sped homeward and Gordon and Fudge
parted midway between their gates. “You come over
after supper, Fudge, and I’ll tell you what that is we
were talking about.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I guess I don’t care to know,” replied
Fudge a trifle haughtily. Gordon laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a chump. We were only fooling. All the
fellows are going to know about it, but I’ll tell you
first if you’ll come over.”</p>

<p>“You told Lanny first,” Fudge objected doubtfully.
“But—I’ll come.”</p>

<h2 id='c12'>CHAPTER XII<br/>A REVERSED DECISION</h2>

<p>Two days later the Clearfield Baseball Club
met at the railroad station shortly after dinner
time and boarded the train for Lesterville.
Only Harry Bryan was missing. A press of
business had developed at the grocery store and Mr.
Bryan had, to Harry’s sorrow, set his foot down on a
Saturday holiday. A small youth named Tim Turner,
a youthful crony of Fudge’s, was drafted to play in
right field and Jack Tappen was moved to second in
Harry’s place.</p>

<p>None of the fellows was very hopeful of beating
Lesterville, for the neighboring mill town had maintained
for several years a nine which averaged fully
two years older than Clearfield. But, as Dick pointed
out, the game would be fine practice, even if they were
beaten. “We really need,” said Dick, “to run up
against a spanking good nine and see how the game is
played.”</p>

<p>Some of the fellows hooted at that, but Dick only
smiled. “That’s all right,” he replied. “I’ll wager
that you’ll learn one or two tricks to-day worth knowing.”</p>

<p>“What’s their pitcher like?” inquired Fudge anxiously.</p>

<p>“They have two of them, Fudge, and they’re both
pretty good.”</p>

<p>“They won’t be hard for Fudge,” said Pete Robey.
“Fudge will eat ’em alive!”</p>

<p>“Bet you I make as many hits as you do,” responded
Fudge eagerly. “Come on, now! Wh-wh-what do
you say?”</p>

<p>But Pete only grinned and shook his head. You
couldn’t start an argument with Pete.</p>

<p>On the way to Lesterville Dick exhibited a list of
games which he had already arranged. Rutter’s Point
was to play a return contest on the High School field
a week from to-day, Logan was to visit Clearfield the
following Wednesday and Corwin was to come a week
later. “We have next Wednesday open,” explained
Dick, “and a week from Saturday. I don’t believe
we’ll be able to find a game for Wednesday, but I’ve
written Shirley at Springdale to get up a team to play
us that Saturday. I’ve told him we’d go over there.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” exclaimed Tom Haley. “I’d love to have
another chance at those fellows!”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it won’t be quite the same team
that we played last month,” said Dick. “I dare say
some of their fellows have gone away for the summer.
But that gives us three games anyhow, and
perhaps four. And I heard of a team over at Locust
Valley which may like to play us.”</p>

<p>“All those games are at home, too,” reflected Lanny.
“How about trying that scheme to charge admission,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“No harm in trying it,” returned the manager
thoughtfully. “Whether it will go or not we’ll have to
see. We could get a few notices printed and stick
them around in the windows down town. And I guess
the paper will announce the games if we ask.”</p>

<p>“A lot of folks will pay a quarter to see a good
game,” said Jack Tappen.</p>

<p>“Would you?” challenged Gordon.</p>

<p>“Sure,” laughed Jack, “if I had the quarter!”</p>

<p>“Not if he could find a crack in the fence,” said
Fudge.</p>

<p>“Look here,” announced Will Scott, “someone said
they were surveying the athletic field, Dick. Suppose
they start to work there in a day or two. We couldn’t
play those games, could we?”</p>

<p>“In that case we’ll play the teams on their own
grounds.”</p>

<p>“It makes it pretty expensive,” objected Way. “I’m
nearly broke now. If I lose my return ticket someone
will have to pay my fare back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the walking’s good,” replied Tom carelessly.</p>

<p>“Another thing,” said Lanny. “If we play away
from home we can’t make any money.”</p>

<p>At that most of the fellows observed each other with
questioning and somewhat dismayed glances. Dick,
studying his list, replied:</p>

<p>“That doesn’t make much difference, does it? None
of those places are far away and it won’t break us to
pay trolley fares. After all, we don’t need the money
as far as I see.”</p>

<p>“Don’t we!” exploded Jack. “We need it like anything!”</p>

<p>Curtis Wayland kicked him on the ankle and Jack
subsided.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Dick, mildly surprised. “We’ve
got four balls that haven’t been used and three that
are still good. We’ve got bats and gloves and a
mask and about everything else. I thought we were
in this for the fun of it. What do we want to make
money for?”</p>

<p>But Jack only mumbled, while the others regarded
him with threatening looks. Will Scott changed the
subject gracefully.</p>

<p>“You fellows don’t want to forget that there’s a
meeting to-night about the new field. You’d better
all show up. We want to get as many there as possible.”</p>

<p>“Thought it was just a meeting of the committee,”
said Gordon.</p>

<p>“No, it’s public. We want to find out what the
fellows think about it before we go ahead and do
anything.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that there’s more than one thing we
can think about it,” observed Tom. “The old field’s
going and we’ve got to have another. That’s dead
simple.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we may have to rent ground,” replied
Way. “And we want to know how far out of town
fellows are willing to go. And how much we ought
to pay.”</p>

<p>“And whether to get a place on the town side or
across the river. There’s a field over toward the
Point, right near the car line, that might do.”</p>

<p>“That’s a long way from school, though,” objected
Fudge.</p>

<p>“Any place we find is going to be a long way,” replied
Will. “There isn’t any place in town big enough
to play baseball on. As a matter of fact, the whole
thing is a good deal of a puzzle. It’s going to cost
us a lot of money, any way you look at it. We’ve
got to have a new track and we’ve got to fence the
field in and move the grandstand to it. It’s going
to cost like sixty. I wish old man Brent had to make
us a present of the old field or lose his money.”</p>

<p>“Stingy old codger,” muttered Fudge.</p>

<p>“There’s no sense in blaming Mr. Brent, Fudge,”
said Dick. “We ought to be grateful to him for
letting us have the field as long as he has. What we’ll
have to do is get subscriptions from the graduates
and anyone else we can. The next station is ours,
fellows. Get your bags together.”</p>

<p>Lesterville was an unlovely town filled with smoking
chimneys and the busy whirr of looms. A
muddy canal intersected it and on either side immense
brick mill buildings ran for the better part
of a mile. But the boys didn’t tarry long in the town.
A green trolley car bore them swiftly away from
the belching chimneys and the hot, weary looking
streets and out to the edge of the country. The
ball ground was surrounded by a sagging fence and
was ridiculously small. A long hit down the right
or left foul line was certain to go over the fence,
while even a good clout into center was likely to disappear
through some hole in the rotting boards. A
few unsheltered seats were clustered close to the first
base line and these were already occupied when the
Clearfield team arrived. The dressing-room was a
ten-foot square space, unroofed, thrown together behind
the stand. As the fellows changed into their
togs the spectators on the top row of seats looked
down upon them and offered sarcastic advice and rude
comments. Fudge in particular aroused their humor
and he was pestered so that he got his playing shirt
on wrong side to.</p>

<p>The Lesterville nine was a pretty husky aggregation.
Most of them were mill employees and their
average age must have been fully eighteen. The audience
was particularly partisan and offensive, and Dick,
settling himself on the visitors’ bench in the broiling
sun and opening his score-book, reflected that it was
perhaps well that there was no likelihood of Clearfield
going home with the ball. He fancied that the
hundred or so local sympathizers would make it quite
uncomfortable for the visiting team if it won!</p>

<p>There’s no necessity of following Clearfield’s fortunes
that afternoon in detail. The contest was fairly
featureless up to the eighth inning. The visitors could
do nothing with Moriarity, the Lesterville pitcher,
only three hits, one of them distinctly scratchy, accruing
to their score and bringing in but one tally.
On the other hand the home team showed itself very
capable with the stick and Tom Haley’s best offerings
were not puzzling after the second inning.</p>

<p>A slight attack of stage-fright in that round on the
part of Clearfield aided the home players. Almost
every member of the visitors’ infield managed to make
an error, while Tom’s wild throw to first in the third
allowed Lesterville to add two runs to her already
swelling score. When the eighth inning began Lesterville
had nine runs to Clearfield’s one, and there
seemed no reason to suppose that the final tally would
be any more complimentary to Clearfield.</p>

<p>Dick had predicted that his charges would learn
some new tricks and his prediction was verified. Clearfield
was the innocent victim of several plays quite
outside her ken. Unfortunately, most of them were
the sort she didn’t care to emulate. For instance, when
Curtis Wayland tried to steal second on Jack Tappen’s
lucky grounder into short right he failed for
the simple reason that second baseman and shortstop
occupied the base line and Way had to crawl
around them to touch the bag. Unfortunately, by that
time right fielder had sped the ball to shortstop, and
the umpire, a young gentleman whose impartiality had
all along been in grave doubt, ruled Way out. Of
course Clearfield protested. Way lost his head and
threatened bodily injury to the second baseman, who
topped him by six inches, and some dozen or so Lesterville
youths flocked to the scene. Gordon, however,
lugged Way, protesting bitterly, from the field
and then quietly asked the umpire to reverse his decision.
But the umpire wouldn’t even listen and there
was nothing for the visitors to do but swallow their
indignation and accept the ruling. Again, earlier in
the contest, the Lesterville pitcher objected to having
a new ball thrown to him after Lanny had fouled a
soiled one into the street, and turning, threw the new
one far into center field. The center fielder refused
to go after it and the umpire yielded, throwing out
another old ball.</p>

<p>Still, Lesterville did show some playing that the
visitors opened their eyes at. Such base-running Gordon’s
team had never witnessed. One red-headed
youth named Myers never failed to steal second yards
ahead of the ball and on one occasion stole all the
way around the bases, reaching home on Tom’s wind-up
and subsequent hurried and wild pitch. The Lesterville
fellows were born ball players and had graduated
from the back lots outside the factories. They
knew every trick of the game and used them all.</p>

<p>When Clearfield went to bat in the eighth it was
Jack’s turn with the stick and Jack connected with a
straight one and slammed it far out into left field,
where it banged against the fence and rolled away
from the fielder while Jack reached second with time
to spare. Tim Turner fanned, Pete Robey worked a
pass and Lanny hit into what should have been an
easy double. But the Lesterville second baseman fumbled
the ball and the bases were full. Unfortunately,
with one out, it was Fudge’s turn at bat and Tom
Haley followed Fudge. It looked to the visitors on
the bench very much like another shut-out. But Fudge,
perhaps still smarting under the gibes that had been
thrown at him all the afternoon, surprised himself
and everyone else by hitting cleanly between first and
second. Two runs came in, Lanny reached third and
Fudge stood panting on first. Tom Haley went out
on strikes and Will Scott came to bat. Fudge stole
without challenge. Will fouled off three and had two
balls to his credit. Then something that looked good
came his way and he swung at it mightily. The ball
streaked far out into center field and the bases emptied.
Will got to second safely, heard the frantic cries of
the coachers and sprinted for third. Then in came
the ball to shortstop, and that youth turned quickly
and pegged to third. The sphere went fully four feet
above third baseman’s head and Will legged it
home while his team-mates on the bench shouted and
cavorted and Dick, being unable to jump around, beat
the ground with a crutch!</p>

<p>Nine to seven looked a heap better than nine to one,
and there was still but one man out. Clearfield had
ecstatic visions of a victory. But the Lesterville
pitcher settled down and disposed of Gordon with five
pitched balls and made Way pop up an easy fly to right
fielder, and the eighth inning was over for the visitors.</p>

<p>Lesterville came back in her half with vigor and
poor Tom was kept dodging liners that soon filled
the bases. But the home team had a streak of bad
luck in that inning. The runner from third was struck
by a streaking liner that was meant for left field, and,
fortunately for the opponents, the ball, after colliding
sharply with the base-runner’s leg, rolled toward the
pitcher’s box and Tom scooped it up and got it to
first ahead of the batsman, who, counting on a two-base
hit, had made a slow start. Lesterville resented
her ill-fortune and, with two gone, the next batsman
sent a long fly into left field that barely escaped going
over the fence and had Way chasing around like a
chicken with its head off while two tallies were added
to Lesterville’s nine. A moment later Tom secured his
fifth strike-out of the contest and the teams changed
sides.</p>

<p>There was still a chance to win, declared Dick, and
Jack was instructed to lay down a bunt along third
base line. Jack followed instructions deftly and to
the letter. The ball trickled a scant ten feet and, although
third baseman came in for it and both
catcher and pitcher did their best, Jack was easily
safe. Young Turner, instructed to sacrifice Jack to
second, did his best but struck out miserably for the
fourth time. Pete got the signal for a hit-and-run
play and swung at the third ball. He missed it, but
the Lesterville catcher, who so far had been pegging
the ball to second with deadly aim, threw
low and before the shortstop had secured the ball
Jack was sprawled in the dust with one foot on the
bag.</p>

<p>Pete, with two strikes against him, was wary. Twice
he spoiled good ones by fouling and then he was
caught napping and retired to the bench with trailing
bat. With two down the game looked to be over.
But Lanny evidently thought otherwise, for he hit
the first delivery squarely on the nose and Jack leaped
away for third. The ball sped high toward center and
although second baseman made a gallant attempt to get
it, it went over his head. Jack turned third and
streaked for the plate. The center fielder, however,
had come in fast and now the ball was flying to the
catcher. Lanny sped to second on the throw-in. Ten
feet away from the home plate Jack hurled himself
feet-foremost through a cloud of dust, rolled over the
base and out of the way just as the ball settled into
the catcher’s mitt. The umpire spread his hands wide
to signify that the runner was safe, but the catcher
turned fiercely on him.</p>

<p>“He never touched it!” he bawled. “Look at where
he went!” He indicated a mark far back of the plate.</p>

<p>“Who didn’t touch it?” demanded Jack, scandalized
and indignant. “I rolled over it!”</p>

<p>Players ran up excitedly. The umpire hesitated,
glanced from the belligerent catcher to the
astounded Jack, shook his head and said: “He’s
out!”</p>

<p>“<i>What!</i>” shrieked Jack.</p>

<p>“Sure you’re out,” said the pitcher with a grin.
“You didn’t go anywhere near the plate. Beat it,
kid!”</p>

<p>Gordon grabbed Jack’s arm and hustled him toward
the bench, pursued by the laughter of the Lesterville
players and the gibes of the spectators, crowding off
the stand. At second Lanny got to his feet and
tramped morosely in to the bench.</p>

<p>“I was all over the plate!” Jack was declaring
fiercely. “He’s a robber!”</p>

<p>“Of course you were,” agreed Gordon soothingly.
“He knows it, but he’s scared of the bunch. Never
mind, it’s all in the day’s work, Jack.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I was safe!” sputtered Jack. “What do
you want to quit for? Why don’t you make them
play it out?”</p>

<p>“No good, Jack. Shut up and change your things.
We’ve got to hustle for the train.”</p>

<p>Just then the Lesterville captain walked up to Gordon.
“Say,” he said, “we’ll play you fellows again
some time if you like. You put up a good game, all
right, Merrick.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I dare say we can get together again,” replied
Gordon not overly enthusiastic. “I’ll let you
know.”</p>

<p>“Next time we’ll have a decent umpire,” cried Jack,
pausing on his way to the dressing shed. “That man’s
a thief!”</p>

<p>“Aw, don’t be a baby,” growled the opposing captain.
“You were out all right enough. I saw the
play, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care whether you did or not. I was perfectly
safe. I crossed the plate before the ball ever
got to him!”</p>

<p>“What if you did, kid? You didn’t touch it. That
ump is all right. The trouble is you can’t take a beating.
Chase yourself.”</p>

<p>Jack was fighting mad then and pushed his way
back, but Gordon and some of the others seized him,
while the stragglers from the audience clustered
around, eager for trouble.</p>

<p>“Jack, you get out of here,” directed Dick sternly.</p>

<p>“Like fun I will! That big chump can’t tell
me<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Just one more word and you’ll be suspended!”
Dick spoke very quietly. Jack stared open-mouthed,
his gaze traveling from the derisive face of the Lesterville
captain to the stern countenance of the Clearfield
manager. Gordon and Lanny still held him firmly.
He swallowed hard, rewarded Dick with a baleful
glare and said:</p>

<p>“Go ahead and suspend! You’re a peach of a manager,
anyhow, to stand around and let those robbers
swipe the game on us! You<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>But Gordon and Lanny hustled him promptly
through the throng at that, the crowd dissolved and
the field emptied. In spite of Jack’s protest the game
was recorded: Lesterville, 11; Clearfield, 7.</p>

<h2 id='c13'>CHAPTER XIII<br/>JACK IS SUSPENDED</h2>

<p>They talked it over on the way back in the
train and the consensus of Clearfield opinion
was that, taking into consideration the indisputable
fact that the umpire had been against them
all through the game, the final score was nothing to
be ashamed of. Only Jack failed to subscribe with
any enthusiasm to that verdict. Jack frankly sulked.</p>

<p>Dick called Gordon over to his seat after the discussion
had waned and the fellows had quieted down.
“Who,” he asked, moving his crutches to make room
for Gordon, “can we get to take Jack’s place?”</p>

<p>“To take Jack’s place?” exclaimed Gordon. “Why,
what’s the matter with Jack?”</p>

<p>“I thought you understood that he was suspended,”
replied Dick calmly. “I certainly gave him a fair warning.”</p>

<p>“But—but—” blurted Gordon in bewilderment,
“you can’t do that!”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>Gordon stared. Finally, “Are you in earnest?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Of course. I’m manager of this team. And while
I’m manager the fellows have got to behave. Jack
was all wrong. He had no business talking like that.
In the first place, it wasn’t up to him to protest the
decision. In the next place he might have got us into
a nasty row with those toughs over there. They were
dying for a scrap all along. If they had started anything
we’d have got pretty well mussed up,
Gordie.”</p>

<p>Gordon nodded. “I know,” he said gloomily,
“but—Jack was excited, Dick. And it <i>was</i> a robbery.
You can’t blame him for getting a bit hot about
it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t. I blame him for showing it, or, at least,
proclaiming it. If I’m manager, I’m going to manage.
If I can’t manage, I’m not manager. Which is
it?”</p>

<p>“Why, you’re manager, of course, Dick. But—Jack
won’t like being suspended. In fact, he will
probably get mad and quit altogether.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” replied Dick. “But that’s his
look-out. He’s suspended for a week—if I’m manager.”</p>

<p>“All right,” muttered Gordon. “Of course, you
realize that leaves us in a hole next Saturday, Dick.
Jack’s one of our best players, and I don’t know
where we’ll find anyone to take his place.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I yet. But we’ve got a whole week to
find someone. He’d be suspended, though, if he was
the last player on the team.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to tell him?” asked Gordon uneasily.
Dick smiled.</p>

<p>“Evidently you don’t care to?”</p>

<p>“I surely don’t.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll tell him. He ought to know it, though,
because I usually mean what I say. You needn’t
mention it to anyone to-day. I’ll have a talk with
him to-morrow, maybe.”</p>

<p>“He’ll quit flat-footed,” mourned Gordon. Dick
smiled again.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so. I think I know Jack a little
better than you do, Gordie.”</p>

<p>The next afternoon, an hour or so after dinner,
Dick called Gordon on the telephone. “Can you come
around here for a few minutes?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was just starting, Dick. Anything up?”</p>

<p>“Not much. I wanted to talk to you about a chap
for Jack’s place.”</p>

<p>“Oh! You—you haven’t changed your mind about
that, then?”</p>

<p>“No.” Dick’s voice sounded amused.</p>

<p>“Well<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>” Gordon frowned at the telephone instrument.
“I’ll be over right away, Dick.”</p>

<p>Dick was on the porch, in spite of the fact that it
was raining briskly, and his sister, Grace, was with
him. Grace was thirteen and a very pretty girl, with
dark hair and eyes. She was enveloped in a long
apron and had her sleeves rolled up to her elbows and
explained to Gordon that she was in the middle of
washing up the dinner dishes.</p>

<p>“Dick called me out to read me a perfectly ridiculous
story in the paper,” she laughed. “Read to
Gordon, Dick, and see if he thinks it funny.”</p>

<p>Dick laughed. “Grace was born without a sense
of humor, Gordie, and I find I can’t educate her.”</p>

<p>“Sense of humor!” scoffed Grace. “That story isn’t
the least bit funny. I’ll leave it to Gordon.” She
jumped up. “I must finish those dishes.”</p>

<p>“What’s the story?” asked Gordon, seating himself
well away from the dripping vines.</p>

<p>“The story? Oh, never mind that! Jack’s just
been here.”</p>

<p>“He has? Well—what—how did he take it?” asked
Gordon anxiously.</p>

<p>Dick gravely regarded the point of one shoe. “Well,
I’ll tell you the last thing he said as he went off, Gordie.
He said: ‘Tell Gordon I know a fellow named
Shores who works in the plating factory. He’s a
pretty good ball player. If you like, I’ll talk to him
and see if he will play for us Saturday.’”</p>

<p>Gordon viewed his friend with admiration, and
shook his head helplessly. “I don’t see how you
manage folks the way you do, Dick,” he said.</p>

<p>“That comes of being manager,” laughed Dick.</p>

<p>“If I’d told Jack he was suspended for a week he’d
have sassed me and gone off in a huff and never
played again!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, he wouldn’t! Jack’s a good, sensible
chap. He’s a little bit stuck on himself, but that
doesn’t matter, and he will get over it some time. I
just told him that he was wrong, and made him see
it. And I convinced him without much trouble that
it was for the good of the team that he should sit
on the bench for a week. Of course, he was a bit
huffed at first, but he got over that. In fact, Gordie,
I think he’s rather proud of being suspended. It
sounds sort of professional and big-leaguish!”</p>

<p>“You could convince a fellow it was a real pleasure
to have his head cut off!” said Gordon. “I wish
I had your—your diplomacy.”</p>

<p>“That’s a big word for it, Gordie. Last night’s
meeting was rather a fizzle, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>Gordon nodded gloomily. “I don’t see how we’re
going to get a field in time for football practice if we
don’t do more than we did last night.”</p>

<p>“Too much talk,” agreed Dick. “Somebody ought
to just go ahead and find a field and then make
a report on it. As for paying a hundred and
twenty-five dollars a year rent for one, why,
that’s poppycock. We couldn’t afford it, especially
as we’ll have to build a running track before next
Spring.”</p>

<p>“Way suggested that we could transfer next
Spring’s meet to Springdale. That would give us
nearly two years to fix up a track.”</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea. Most of the fellows seemed to
fancy that place across the river beyond the carpet
mills. It would be fairly near home, but it’s a mean
part of town.”</p>

<p>“Punk! If we have to find a new place—and I
suppose we must—I’m for going out toward the
Point. Fellows seem to think it’s too far out there,
but you can jump on the trolley and get there in no
time. They’d put a stop opposite the field for us if
we asked.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should think Mr. Brent would do that
much for us since he’s taking our field away,” agreed
Dick. “By the way, seen Morris yet?”</p>

<p>“No; I thought I’d go over this afternoon and see
how he is. Maybe he’s receiving callers by this time.
Dick, do you know anything about running an automobile?”</p>

<p>Dick stared. Then he laughed. “Well, hardly,
Gordie! How should I?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course you’ve never run one, but you
know such a raft of stuff fellows usually don’t know
that<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“You thought I’d made a study of autos? No, I’m
afraid I can’t advise you much, Gordie. Thinking of
buying one?”</p>

<p>“N-no, not exactly.”</p>

<p>“Going to rent it, then?”</p>

<p>“No, you idiot. I—I only wondered. I dare say
you could drive an automobile finely, though. Your
arms are all right and you told me once that you
thought of getting one of those velocipede chairs
that you work with your feet.”</p>

<p>“I see what you’re driving at. Old Man Brent has
commissioned you to sell that car of Morris’. Is that
it?”</p>

<p>Gordon looked startled, but shook his head. “No,
he hasn’t. I dare say, though, anyone could buy it
pretty cheap,” he remarked carelessly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I couldn’t afford it, Gordie,” Dick
laughed. “You’ll have to find another buyer.”</p>

<p>“I know. I was just wondering if you <i>could</i> run
an auto if you had one.”</p>

<p>“Why, I suppose so. I’ve got plenty of strength
in my legs when I’m sitting down, you know, and so
far my arms are still working. But I don’t believe
I’ll ever have a chance to try, Gordie. At least, not
unless you get an auto and let me run it for you.
How would I do as a chauffeur?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you could run an auto to the King’s taste,
Dick! You do most everything better than the rest
of us.”</p>

<p>“You mean I think I could! Well, I’m not stuck-up
about my automobile driving, Gordie. That’s one
thing I’m not conceited about. Going now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess I’d better run over to Morris’. I
told his sister I’d look in pretty soon. When he can
see folks, Dick, will you go over with me some time?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Glad to. Let me know when you
want to go.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I thought—you seemed sort of
down on Mr. Brent and maybe you wouldn’t want to
go to his house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not as down on him as all that,” laughed
Dick. “And, anyhow, his house never did anything
to me.” He paused and added soberly: “For that
matter, Gordie, I don’t want you to think that I am
really sore against Mr. Brent. Sometimes I get sort
of peeved about that affair of dad’s, but maybe, after
all, it was more his fault than Mr. Brent’s. Anyway,
I’ve never accused Jonathan Brent of being dishonest.
I don’t think he is. Give my regards to Morris
if you see him, and tell him I’ll come over and call
some day if he doesn’t mind. See you to-morrow
afternoon, Gordie. We’ve got to practice hard this
week. And I’ll tell Jack to look up his friend in the
plating works.”</p>

<h2 id='c14'>CHAPTER XIV<br/>A VISIT TO THE INVALID</h2>

<p>Gordon found Morris not only able but
eager to see him. Louise conducted him
upstairs to a big square bedroom in the
middle of which, between two bay windows, Morris’
bed looked small and lonesome. There was a table
by the bed, and on it was a great vase of pink roses,
and some magazines, books, and glasses. A rocking-chair
near the table with a magazine spread open in
it suggested that someone, probably Louise, had been
reading to the invalid.</p>

<p>Morris lay flat on his back, with only the wispiest
little pillow under his head. Gordon was shocked to
see how pale and drawn he looked as he waved a
hand at the visitor’s entrance and called quite cheerfully
across the room: “Hello, Gordon! Gee, but
I’m glad to see you!”</p>

<p>Gordon took the chair beside the bed and asked
Morris how he felt.</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty good, thanks! My leg’s done up in a
ton of plaster, I guess, and it hurts a good deal. But
the doctor’s tickled to death with it, and so I suppose
I’ve got to be satisfied too. How are you? I
thought you were never coming to see a fellow.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been wanting to come ever since—it happened,”
answered Gordon; “but at first they said I
mustn’t see you, and then, yesterday, there was the
game at Lesterville<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“It must have been a peach of a game, even if you
fellows did get beaten.” Morris paused abruptly and
lowered his eyes. “Say, Gordon, I guess you know
I’m—I’m awfully grateful<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Now, look here,” interrupted Gordon sternly,
“don’t you start that too! I’ve had a lot of it from
your mother and Louise and Mr. Brent, and if you
begin I’ll beat it out of here!”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Morris, “only—well, thanks,
Gordon!” A twinge of pain brought a momentary
scowl to his face. “I was mighty glad you
didn’t get banged up too. It was a wonder you
didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m like a cat; I light on my feet. What happened,
anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know—quite. The first thing I knew the
wheel spun around almost out of my hands and
we were smashing against that fence. I suppose there
was something in the road I didn’t see. I made a
grab for the emergency brake and tried to set it. Then
I got a leg over the side of the car and—and that’s
all I remember. How badly is the car smashed, Gordon?”</p>

<p>“The right front wheel has most of the spokes out
of it, and the axle is bent on that side. And there
are some dents in the running board and radiator and
one lamp’s done for. I don’t believe, though, it will
cost you much to get it fixed up again almost as good
as new. I suppose you’ll have to get rid of it,
though, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Morris grinned. “Rather! And I’ll have to pay
for it, too!”</p>

<p>“Your father says<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“I know; but Stacey has my note for the rest of the
money, and I don’t propose to be a squealer, Gordon.
I’ll get the money somehow. If dad won’t give it to
me, maybe my mother will. I’ll get it somewhere.
I’m not going to have Stacey telling it around that I
don’t keep my word or pay my debts. I wish I’d let
the blamed thing alone; but I didn’t, and so there’s no
use talking about that now.”</p>

<p>“What—what are you going to do with it?” asked
Gordon.</p>

<p>“Get Stacey to sell it for me, I guess. I haven’t
talked to dad about it yet. He only got home from
New York yesterday. I suppose he will be mad when
I tell him I want to pay the rest of the money.”</p>

<p>“I ought to see him, too,” said Gordon uneasily,
“and tell him what Mr. Stacey said. Is—is he at home
to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you’d better wait a while. He always
takes a nap Sunday afternoons. I guess I’ll let you
tell him about Stacey before I tackle him.”</p>

<p>“How much would you sell the car for?” asked
Gordon presently.</p>

<p>“Anything I could get, I guess. Of course, it’s
never been used but a week; the speedometer shows
only two hundred and eighty miles, I think; but I
suppose it’s just as much second-hand as if it had
been run a whole year. I should think Stacey might
get three hundred for it, though.”</p>

<p>Gordon looked disappointed. “Oh!” he murmured.
“Well, I suppose it is worth all of that. Only, I was
thinking<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Morris.</p>

<p>“It—it sounds sort of cheeky,” replied Gordon, after
a moment’s hesitation, “and you might not think much
of the idea, but what I—what we were considering is
this, Morris.” He drew the chair closer to the bed,
with a glance at the half-open door, and lowered his
voice.</p>

<p>An hour or so later Gordon left Brentwood well
satisfied. Mr. Brent had only smiled at Mr. Stacey’s
ultimatum, thanked Gordon for the trouble he had
taken, and approved of the rescue and temporary disposal
of the automobile. “We’ll let it stay where it is
for the present,” he said, “and I’ll have a talk with
Morris about it some day. If Stacey doesn’t want to
take it back, I guess we can get the junkman to haul
it away.”</p>

<p>“I think Morris has a—a scheme, sir, that would be
pretty fine,” returned Gordon. “That is, if—if you
were willing.”</p>

<p>“A scheme? What sort of a scheme, Merrick?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather he told you about it, sir.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I don’t think much of Morris’ schemes
as a rule,” replied Mr. Brent grimly. “However, I’ll
hear what he has to say.”</p>

<p>On Tuesday placards in the shop windows made
the following announcement:</p>

<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>BASEBALL!</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>Clearfield vs. Rutter’s Point,</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>HIGH SCHOOL FIELD,</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>Saturday at 3 P. M.</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>Admission: 25 Cents.</p>

<p>Also on that morning the Clearfield <i>Reporter</i> obligingly
called the public’s attention to the game and
predicted a close and exciting contest. The notice in
the newspaper cost the club nothing, but the printed
announcements took just a dollar and sixty-five cents
from the exchequer, and caused Fudge, whose portion
of the expense amounted to eighteen and one-third
cents, a deal of gloom.</p>

<p>“Nobody’s going to pay real money to see a lot of
kids play ball,” said Fudge. “So what’s the good of
spending all that on notices? Gee, we could have
bought a new ball with that money!”</p>

<p>One or two others thought as Fudge did, but most
of the team were optimistic, and Tim Turner was
created ticket seller and gateman, and was to receive
fifty cents for his services. Fudge declared that if
Tim sold enough admissions to pay himself his wages
he’d be “m-m-m-mighty lucky!” But as events proved
Fudge was unnecessarily pessimistic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on Monday, Jack Tappen had fulfilled
his agreement to find a substitute, and Danny Shores
was duly “signed up” for Saturday’s game with the
Point. Danny, who proved to be a long and lanky
youth of sixteen or seventeen years, showed up for
practice on Wednesday and made a good impression
in right field and at the bat. Unfortunately, Wednesday
was the only day he could get off, and, as Jack
assured Dick, it took a lot of wire-pulling to secure
that concession from Danny’s boss at the plating
works. However, Danny played ball more or less
every lunch-hour behind the factory, and so was by no
means out of practice. Jack’s demeanor was amusing
that week. He tried to look chastened and sad, but
it was easy to see that he took it as a personal compliment,
that suspension, and was vastly proud of it.
Jack appeared to reason that if he hadn’t been an
extraordinarily valuable member of the team Dick
would not have taken the trouble to discipline him!
Jack was as busy as a hive of bees, and was so generous
with advice that Dick and Gordon found him
something of a nuisance.</p>

<p>“I wish he was playing ball instead of sitting on
the bench,” confided Gordon, in comic despair. “Next
time, Dick, throw him in the river, but don’t suspend
him. He’s as pleased as Punch with himself!”</p>

<p>Of course, the others tried their best to have their
fun with Jack, but the attempt was not very successful.
Jack seemed to consider that a signal honor had
been done him, and, while he professed to be chagrined
and ashamed of his position, he was secretly
well contented and was enjoying it all greatly. As
Dick said, one could have stood that well enough if
Jack hadn’t tried to run the team!</p>

<p>But Jack Tappen was not the only cross that Dick
had to bear just then. As a tutor Dick was having his
troubles, too. Harold Townsend had at last, to use
Caspar Billings’ expression, “laid down in the shafts.”
Not only that, but he was “kicking over the traces” as
well. Dick was pretty nearly at his wits’ end. The
pupil’s first slight awe of his teacher had soon worn
off, and now he was frankly mutinous. He no longer
made pretense of studying the lessons Dick laid out
for him, only grinned exasperatingly when taken to
task, and, in short, openly defied authority. Dick worried
for two reasons: In the first place, he disliked
to be beaten. In the second place, he felt that he had
no right to take money from Harold’s mother when
he was not earning it. And he wanted the money and
needed it. Harold apparently realized that any appeal
to his mother by Dick would be useless. And Dick
was pretty certain of as much himself. Nevertheless,
on Thursday of that week he decided that the time had
come for an understanding. Loring, Harold’s older
brother, had threatened all sorts of dire punishment
if that youth didn’t behave, but the threats had not
impressed Harold much. Perhaps he knew that Loring
wouldn’t carry them out. On Thursday the lesson
had been the merest farce, and Harold’s behavior
had for once almost caused Dick to lose command
of a usually well-governed temper. At last:</p>

<p>“I shall have to talk to your mother, Harold,” he
said. “This kind of thing can’t go on. You’re wasting
your time and mine<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Aw, you get paid, don’t you?” asked Harold, with
a scowl.</p>

<p>“I get paid for teaching, not for loafing,” responded
Dick sharply. “I shall want to see you when I come
back. So don’t go off, please.”</p>

<p>“I shall if I want to. You don’t own me, Lovering.
Besides, study time’s up, anyway.”</p>

<p>Dick, disdaining to answer, set off to find Mrs.
Townsend. The conference took place on a corner of
the hotel veranda. Mrs. Townsend was a sweet-voiced,
pretty woman, with a tired air. At first she
seemed to resent Dick’s charge against her boy. Then
she grew pathetic, and bewailed the fact of her husband’s
death.</p>

<p>“If he had lived,” she sighed, “Harold would have
been a different boy. I’ve never been able to do anything
with him. He needs a stronger hand, I fear.
Perhaps—that is, possibly—er—it would have been
better to have found someone—someone a little older
to take him in hand. Of course, I don’t mean
to suggest that you haven’t done excellently, Mr.
Lovering, for I’m quite sure you have; but, of
course, as you are so little older than Harold,
he may feel—er—you see what I mean, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, but I don’t think that’s the trouble. Harold
doesn’t want to study, doesn’t seem to see the
necessity of learning and won’t. If I had full authority
over him<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you have! I thought that was understood.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for two hours, perhaps, Mrs. Townsend; but
what I mean is that if I—well, if you’d just back me
up, I’m sure I could accomplish something.”</p>

<p>“Please explain. I don’t think I understand.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s like this,” replied Dick desperately: “He
knows now that if he doesn’t want to learn his lessons
he doesn’t have to. So he doesn’t do any work. If—if
you’d make him understand that he <i>does</i> have to,
Mrs. Townsend, that if he doesn’t he will be—punished<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’ve never punished Harold!” she protested.
“I don’t believe in punishment; that is, other
than verbal. A high-spirited boy such as he is—er<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, I know, but you want him to go to Rifle
Point, and he will never get there if he doesn’t take
some interest in his lessons and do some work. See
here, please.” Dick had provided himself with
a Rifle Point School catalogue, and now he
went over for Mrs. Townsend’s benefit the list
of studies required for entrance. Mrs. Townsend
listened with a puzzled, tired frown on her pretty
forehead.</p>

<p>“And you think he isn’t far enough advanced, Mr.
Lovering, to enter this Fall?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t advanced at all!” blurted Dick. “What
he has learned he has forgotten. He—he’s two years
behind those requirements, Mrs. Townsend.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! And I had hoped<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>” She sighed
tremulously. “What do you advise?”</p>

<p>“I advise you to make Harold understand that he’s
got to do what I tell him to, and that if he doesn’t he
will be punished.”</p>

<p>“But I never could punish him!”</p>

<p>“No’m, I’m sure of that,” agreed Dick. “You let
me do it.”</p>

<p>“You?” she faltered. “Could you—that is<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean whip him, Mrs. Townsend, or anything
like that. I’ll find a way that will answer quite
as well.”</p>

<p>“Could you really? But how?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know just yet,” Dick owned. “But I’ll find
a way. Really, Mrs. Townsend, you’ll have to do
something of that sort. Harold’s just wasting his
time and mine. And I can’t take your money when
I’m not earning it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’m sure you are! Even if—if Harold
doesn’t get on very fast, it is a great relief to me to
know that for two hours a day at least he is in good
care and not—not running around with those horrid
bell-boys. I’m sure that’s worth every penny of the
money!”</p>

<p>“Not to me, ma’am. I mean I wouldn’t be satisfied
to go on with things as they are now. I wish
you’d try my way, Mrs. Townsend. All I’d want
you to do would be just to tell Harold that he is to do
absolutely as I tell him to, and that there is no use in
his appealing to you.”</p>

<p>“We—ell, if you’re quite certain it won’t break his
spirit or—or anything like that,” agreed Mrs. Townsend
doubtfully. “I do want him to get on, Mr. Lovering.
If only he had half the studiousness that Loring
has!”</p>

<p>“He can study very well when he wants to,” replied
Dick dryly. “And I’m pretty sure I can make
him want to if you will just stand back of me, Mrs.
Townsend.”</p>

<p>“I will, really and truly,” she said. “Thank you so
much, Mr. Lovering. I—I’ll speak to Harold this
evening, and<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you speak to him now just as well,
please?”</p>

<p>“Now? Why, I suppose so. If you wish. Perhaps
I’d better, and get it over with.” Mrs. Townsend
sighed deeply. “Will you send him to me, Mr. Lovering?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, if I can find him,” answered Dick. “I’m
afraid, though, he’s gone off somewhere. I’ll look
him up, Mrs. Townsend. Thank you very much for—for
helping me.”</p>

<p>Harold was not in his room where Dick had left
him, and inquiry around the corridor of the hotel at
first failed to elicit any information. Ultimately, however,
Dick found a boy who had seen Harold walking
down the beach about a half hour before and Dick set
off in the indicated direction toward the distant point
of rocks that jutted out into the sea.</p>

<h2 id='c15'>CHAPTER XV<br/>ON THE ROCKS</h2>

<p>It was hard going for Dick, for his crutches sank
into the sand nearly to the depth of their rubber
tips, but he persevered, and after some ten minutes
of “crutching” arrived at the end of the beach
where the point of rock from which the place received
its name advanced from the grassy bluff and waded
far into the breakers. Harold was not in sight when
Dick reached the bottom of the ledge; but a few moments
later when by careful climbing Dick had
reached the seaward end of the rock, he came into
view. The receding tide had left a long and narrow
pool in a cleft of the ledge, a pool whose sides were
festooned with delicate seaweed and set with purple
mussels and green and brown snails and in whose bottom
pink starfish crawled. Harold, perched at the
edge of the pool, was looking fascinatingly into the
clear green depths and didn’t hear the soft tap of
Dick’s crutches until the older boy was almost beside
him. Then he turned startledly, narrowly escaping a
bath in the pool, and scowled at the intruder.</p>

<p>“Had to hunt for me, anyway, didn’t you?” he asked
sneeringly.</p>

<p>Dick paid the question no heed. Instead, he moved
to the edge of the pool and peered interestedly into
it. He didn’t have to feign interest, he was interested.
It seemed a long time to Dick since he had crouched,
as Harold was crouched now, and gazed fascinatingly
at the wonders of a rock pool. Nor had he done it
very frequently, for climbing over the ledges is
hard and risky work for a boy without two
good legs. Harold continued to frown at a
wavering starfish in the depths, but presently,
as Dick did not speak, he shot a curious glance at
him.</p>

<p>“Gee,” he said to himself, “you’d think he’d never
seen starfish and things before!”</p>

<p>Dick took off his hat and wiped his moist forehead.
Then he lowered himself cautiously to a seat
on the rock. “Regular natural aquarium, isn’t it?”
he asked pleasantly. Harold’s reply was an unintelligible
growl. “Lots of queer things in there,” went on
Dick musingly.</p>

<p>“Sure; I just saw a whale,” replied Harold sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Did you? Your eyes must be pretty good,”
returned Dick, with a smile. “I dare say, though, I see
something you don’t.”</p>

<p>Harold viewed him suspiciously. Finally: “What?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“A sea-anemone.”</p>

<p>“A sea-what?”</p>

<p>“Sea-anemone.” Dick laughed. “I sea-anemone;
what do you see?”</p>

<p>“That’s a punk joke!” scoffed Harold.</p>

<p>“I’m not joking. I’ll point him out to you. Lean
over this way. See that purplish-brown thing on the
side near the bottom? Looks like a flower, sort of.
See?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Is that it? It isn’t a flower, though; it
moves, don’t it?” Harold was interested in spite of
himself.</p>

<p>“Yes, it moves, and it isn’t a flower. It’s a polyp.
It’s name is Metridium something or other; I forget
the rest of it.”</p>

<p>“What’s a polyp? An animal?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, of a low order. About as much as a sponge
is.”</p>

<p>“Pooh, a sponge is a vegetable!” derided the other.</p>

<p>“Not exactly. Those things that move are little
tentacles with which it feeds itself,” said Dick, pointing
again at the anemone.</p>

<p>“What’s it eat?” asked Harold curiously.</p>

<p>“All sorts of animal matter that floats around in
the water and that is so small we can’t see it.”</p>

<p>Harold observed him suspiciously. “I don’t believe
it’s alive at all,” he said presently. “It’s just a sort
of seaweed, and it moves because the water moves.”</p>

<p>“Think so?” asked Dick. “Then put your hand
down there toward it and see what happens.”</p>

<p>“It won’t—bite, will it?” asked Harold doubtfully.</p>

<p>“No, but it will show you whether it’s alive or not.
You needn’t touch it,” he added, noting the other’s
hesitancy. “Just put your hand near it or disturb the
water.”</p>

<p>Harold pulled his sleeve up and cautiously thrust
an arm into the pool. “Gee!” he exclaimed. “It shut
its mouth!”</p>

<p>Dick laughed. “Doesn’t look much like it did, does
it?”</p>

<p>“No; it’s an ugly little thing now,” responded the
other. “Say, that’s funny, isn’t it? Guess it’s alive,
all right.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and it knows three things pretty well: It
knows how to attach itself to the rocks, how to get
food, and how to shut up shop when trouble brews.”</p>

<p>“What would it do if you took it out?”</p>

<p>“Die. Besides, it’s stuck on there so hard you’d
have to pull it to pieces to get it off. I tried it once
when I was a kid, and had to give it up.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to find a sea-urchin,” said Harold. “I’ve
got a lot of starfish and a horse-shoe crab and some
razor-clam shells and two shark eggs. I guess I’ll
get that big starfish down there, too.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” asked Dick. “It’s just like
those you’ve got. Let the old chap live and enjoy
himself.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get it if I want to,” replied Harold. “Say,
what did you follow me out here for, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Because I told your mother I’d find you and send
you to her. She’s got something to say to you.”</p>

<p>“Sure! I suppose you went and told her a lot of
lies about me.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose anything of the sort,” responded
Dick quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, I’m not afraid of her.”</p>

<p>“Of course not, but you want to do what she
wishes, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“That’s my business,” replied the other ungraciously.
“I do as I please.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a lucky chap, then,” said Dick pleasantly.
“By the way, are you going to see the ball
game Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so. That is”—with elaborate concern—“unless
you don’t want me to.”</p>

<p>“I was going to say that if you’ll ask for me at the
gate I’ll pass you in, Harold.”</p>

<p>“Why, are they going to charge?”</p>

<p>“Yes; twenty-five cents.”</p>

<p>“Gee, they’ve got a crust! Who’d pay twenty-five
cents to see a lot of wooden-heads play ball?”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re hoping a lot will. Anyway, you won’t
have to. Just ask for me at the gate. I guess it
will be a pretty good game. Do you like baseball?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Do you play?”</p>

<p>“Sure! What do you think I am—a wooden Indian?”</p>

<p>“That’s good. They have a pretty good team at
Rifle Point. Maybe you’ll make it some day.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any maybe about it. I’m going to.”</p>

<p>“I hope so. Well, I must be getting back. You
coming along? It must be very nearly lunch time.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not,” growled Harold. “I’ll come when
I’m ready.”</p>

<p>“All right. By the way, we won’t have any lessons
to-morrow. Nothing doing until Monday. Meanwhile
you see if you can’t get the better of that algebra,
like a good fellow. So-long!”</p>

<p>“Long!” muttered Harold.</p>

<p>Dick pulled himself up and fixed his crutches and
began the laborious task of climbing back up the rock
and across to the beach. Fortunately his rubber tips
held well, and he was soon at the top of the ledge. But
there misfortune overtook him. Just what happened
he couldn’t have told, but the result he was very certain
about. For one crutch flew out from under him,
he spun half around on the other and fell backward,
his head coming into violent contact with the granite
ledge. For an instant he was too dazed to move.
His head rang and buzzed like a bee-hive. In falling
he must have cried out involuntarily, for almost
before he had gathered his faculties together and
made a move to get up he heard footsteps pattering
on the rocks, and then the anxious voice of
Harold Townsend:</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Lovering? What happened?”</p>

<p>Harold ran to him, and bent over him with very
genuine concern.</p>

<p>“I—I’m all right, thanks,” replied Dick, a trifle
vaguely. “I fell. That rock is some hard, Harold!”
He rubbed his head ruefully and grimaced as his hand
came in contact with the swelling bruise. “Just give
me a hand, will you? And kick that crutch this way,
please.”</p>

<p>“Here’s your crutch,” said Harold, “but just you
wait where you are a minute.” He sped away down
the slope of the rock, and Dick, with his head throbbing,
for once could not but feel a qualm of envy. In
a moment the younger boy was back. He had dipped
his handkerchief in the water, and now he offered it a
trifle shyly to Dick. “Put it on your head,” he said
gruffly. “It’ll make it feel better.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Harold.” Dick applied the wet compress
to the bump. “It was stupid of me to keel over like
that,” he said. “I don’t know when I’ve fallen down
before.”</p>

<p>“I should think you’d have lots of falls,” replied
Harold. “I think you get around mighty well, Lovering.
How does it feel now?”</p>

<p>“Better, thanks. Just sort of give me a boost, will
you?”</p>

<p>Harold assisting, Dick got to his feet, or, rather, his
crutches, and, with the younger boy watching anxiously,
went on down the ledge to the beach.</p>

<p>“You needn’t come unless you’re ready to,” said
Dick. “I’ll be all right now, Harold.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll go, too,” replied Harold carelessly.
“It’s most lunch time.”</p>

<p>They walked along in silence for a way, and
then Dick asked: “Do you know who Caspar
Billings has got to take Morris Brent’s place on Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Fellow named Jensen. Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not. Pretty good, is he?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. Loring says he is. Say, Mason’s going
to pitch for us. Did you know that?”</p>

<p>“Mason? Oh, he is the fellow who was to have
played in the last game and didn’t get here. Is he a
wonder, Harold?”</p>

<p>“Is he!” Harold chuckled. “You just wait and
see. You fellows won’t be able to touch him!”</p>

<p>“As good as that, eh? By the way, who scores for
your team?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” Harold shrugged his shoulders.
“Nobody, I guess. Why?”</p>

<p>“I should think you’d like to do it.”</p>

<p>Harold considered. “I guess,” he answered finally,
“I don’t know how well enough.”</p>

<p>“I can show you. You bring a book Saturday and
sit by me, and I’ll make a professional scorer of you in
no time.”</p>

<p>“Too much trouble,” replied the other indifferently.</p>

<p>“It isn’t trouble at all, Harold; it’s fun. Better try
it some time. It’s a good thing to know.”</p>

<p>Presently Harold asked: “Why aren’t you coming
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Because we haven’t been getting on very well,
Harold. I thought it might be a good idea for us to
stop for a couple of days and think it over; see
whether we want to go on with it or not, you know.
If we decide that we do, we’ll start all over again Monday
and do the thing right.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” muttered Harold. “What did you tell
my mother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just that I wasn’t willing to go on and take
her money without accomplishing something,” replied
Dick cheerfully. “I told her you could study as well
as your brother if you wanted to<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“She’s always beefing about Loring!” grumbled the
boy.</p>

<p>“And that if you didn’t want to there wasn’t much
use in my coming. Well, I’ll cut through here for the
car. I’ll see you Monday, Harold.”</p>

<p>“What about Saturday?” asked the other. “You
said<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Of course! Look me up, and bring your score-book.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t any.”</p>

<p>“You can get one at Wadsworth’s, on Common
Street. Or I’ll buy one for you, if you like.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t. It’s too much like work. So-long!”</p>

<p>Dick returned to Clearfield more encouraged. If
only Mrs. Townsend would do as she had agreed to,
he believed that he could manage Harold and earn the
money that was being paid him. He had about given
up hope of finding more pupils, and so could ill afford
to lose Harold. He certainly didn’t want to, he
reflected, but he would in an instant rather than make
no better progress than he had been making.</p>

<p>At practice that afternoon, Gordon told him that
Morris had asked to see him, and Dick agreed to call
at the Brents’ for a few minutes before supper. Morris
was pathetically glad to see the two boys and very
loath to have them go again. Mrs. Brent looked in
for a short time and Louise met them on their way out
and thanked them for coming. She looked rather
tired, and Gordon spoke of it.</p>

<p>“It’s been so hot to-day,” she explained, “and I’ve
been indoors a good deal since Morris was hurt. He
can’t read to himself yet, and so I have to do it for
him. Of course, I’m very glad to, but it is hard work
in a way. I wonder if either of you have any books
he’d like. I’ve read about everything I can find.”</p>

<p>“I think I have,” responded Dick. “I’ll bring two
or three over. I guess what Morris wants is a rattling
good adventure story.”</p>

<p>“Yes; he’s crazy to hear stories about ships and
pirates and hidden treasure, you know. About the
only other thing he cares about is the baseball news.
I read that to him every morning, and I’m getting to
be quite—quite learned.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Dick, “the doctor won’t let you
move him out to the Point yet.”</p>

<p>“He says we can go in about another two weeks. I
think it will be much better for Morris. He’s getting
fearfully tired of that room up there. And it is hot,
you know. Thank you both for coming, and do
come again when you can. I guess it isn’t much fun
for you, but Morris looks forward to it all day.”</p>

<p>“She’s a nice girl,” commented Dick, as they passed
through the gate. “Pretty, too.”</p>

<p>“She <i>is</i> nice,” agreed Gordon. “I guess when a
fellow’s laid up like that a sister’s a pretty good thing
to have around.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dick. And, after a moment, he added:
“I’ll find those books and take them around to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“I would,” approved the other. “You’re certain to
find her in then.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a chump, Gordie! She’s only a kid!”</p>

<p>“She’s as old as I am, except for a few months.
And if you call me a kid I’ll lick you.”</p>

<p>“If you do, I’ll suspend you,” replied Dick sternly.</p>

<p>Gordon laughed. “I hope I’d get as much fun out
of it as Jack is getting,” he said. “He confided to me
to-day that you were a fine manager. ‘I tell you, Gordon,’
he said, ‘a manager’s got to have plenty of discipline!’
If you could only fire Jack for good and all,
he’d love you like a brother, Dick!”</p>

<p>“I sort of wish we were going to have him in the
game Saturday,” said Dick. “We’ll miss his batting,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if this fellow Mason is as good as they
seem to think him. Anyone know where he comes
from?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask. He’s probably better than Porter,
though. I have a feeling that we’re due to get the
short end of the score day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised. I hope to goodness Harry
can play. If he is out of it, we will be in a mess!”</p>

<p>“How is Tom getting on with his shingling or painting
or whatever it is he’s doing?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, it would be a good thing if he could come out
and practice a little more. It’s too bad we can’t find
another fellow to help out with the pitching, Gordie.
If Tom got sick we’d be in a fix.”</p>

<p>“We surely would! But I don’t believe Tom was
ever sick in his life. Anyway, he was pretty fit to-day.
I caught him for a few minutes, and he had everything
there is.”</p>

<p>Dick smiled. “Tom has just three balls, Gordie:
an out, a pretty good drop, and a fast one that’s a
peach. That’s all he needs, though. If he mixes
them up right he can get by. But we’ve got to find
our batting eye Saturday if we’re to win. How about
the line-up? Think we’d better change it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. This fellow Shores had better follow
Lanny, don’t you think? He seems to think he can
bat, but he didn’t connect with much yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he was embarrassed,” suggested Dick, with
a smile.</p>

<p>“Embarrassed!” said Gordon. “Yes, about as much
embarrassed as a bull-pup! Maybe he will do better in
a game, though. Well, so-long, Dick. I’ll have to
hustle or I’ll be late for supper.”</p>

<p>“Coming around to-night?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so. I told Lanny I’d go over there.
See you to-morrow, though.”</p>

<p>“Come over in the morning, will you? I’m not
going out to the Point to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You’re not? You haven’t quit, have you?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet. I’m giving Harold a day or two to
think over his sins. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“I say, Dick, don’t forget your call.”</p>

<p>“What call?” asked Dick, from the end of the
hedge.</p>

<p>“Why, on Miss Brent!”</p>

<p>“You’ll sit on the bench if you’re not careful,”
laughed Dick.</p>

<h2 id='c16'>CHAPTER XVI<br/>DICK SCORES A DEFEAT</h2>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that!”
ejaculated Fudge awedly. He and Lanny
were approaching the athletic field at a
little after two on Saturday. Ahead of them, as they
turned the corner, was a group of some fifty or sixty
persons, mostly boys and young men, and they were
quite evidently waiting for the gate to open.</p>

<p>“And it isn’t half-past two yet,” said Lanny.
“Looks as if we were going to have an audience, after
all, Fudge.”</p>

<p>“Bet you they don’t know they have to pay a quarter,”
responded the other pessimistically.</p>

<p>“Then they’re blind, because there’s a notice right
beside the gate there.”</p>

<p>“Someone ought to find Tim and get him here,”
said Fudge anxiously. “They might change their
minds and go away again!”</p>

<p>“What time is he supposed to get here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Half-past, I suppose.” They passed
through a smaller gate which led to the dressing-room
and found Dick and Gordon already on hand. Fudge
told his fears to Dick, and Dick reassured him by
agreeing to take the gate himself until young Mr. Turner
appeared. Five minutes later the first two or three
rows of the grandstand were occupied, and spectators
were still dribbling through the gate and depositing
quarters in Dick’s hand. Tim Turner arrived breathless
soon after and relieved Dick. Some thirty Rutter’s
Point residents accompanied their team and still
further swelled the audience, and by three o’clock Dick
estimated that fully a hundred and sixty persons
had paid admission. That was much better than
anyone had dared hope, and Lanny, making a
lightning calculation, confided to Gordon that there’d
be thirty dollars coming to the club after Rutter’s
Point had received the twenty-five per cent. agreed
on.</p>

<p>“If we can do that often enough,” said Lanny delightedly,
“we’ll have more than enough for<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“S-sh!” cautioned Gordon.</p>

<p>“He’s over there talking to Billings. Who is the
kid with him?”</p>

<p>“That’s young Townsend, the fellow he’s coaching.
It’s about time to start, isn’t it? There come three
more, Lanny.”</p>

<p>“Every little quarter helps,” replied Lanny. “I hope
Tim Turner doesn’t abscond with the cash! Someone
ought to stand over him with a bat! Oh, Fudge!”</p>

<p>“What’s wanted?” asked Fudge, joining them.</p>

<p>“We wanted to tell you that if Tim runs off with
the money you will have to make good.”</p>

<p>Fudge grinned. “He’s awfully excited,” he said.
“He’s got both pockets full of silver, and sounds like
a treasury when he moves. He’s terribly worried
because he gave one fellow too much change. He
says he knows him, though, and is going to get it
back!”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Gordon. “On the run, fellows.
You’re in right field, Shores. Throw out another ball,
Jack, will you? Here you are, Harry!”</p>

<p>A minute later Captain Billings faced Tom Haley,
and the game began.</p>

<p>The batting list of the visiting team had been
changed in two instances, Jensen replacing Morris
Brent in left field, and Mason pitching instead of Porter.
Melville, or “Mel,” Mason was a big youth of
eighteen at least, with a quiet, self-constrained manner
that impressed Dick and filled him with forebodings
of defeat. Clearfield was minus the services of Jack
Tappen, Mr. Daniel Shores making his first appearance
in a purple uniform and holding down Jack’s
place in right field. The umpire was Mr. Cochran,
physical director at the Young Men’s Christian Association,
and a great favorite among the boys.</p>

<p>Rutter’s Point failed to do anything in the first
inning. Tom Haley allowed only one player to reach
first, and he got no farther. When Clearfield came
to the bat, with Harry Bryan up, the audience proved
its loyalty to the home team by loud and prolonged
cheering. It was very soon evidenced that “Mel”
Mason was in a different class from Bede Porter as
a pitcher. Who he was or where he came from neither
Dick nor Gordon had learned; but, to use Fudge’s
admiring and slightly resentful expression, he was
“some pitchist!” He had plenty of speed when he
cared to use it, but his favorite offering was a slow
ball that was probably patterned on the “floater” of a
famous league pitcher. The Clearfield batters hit under
it or over it with discouraging regularity, and
Harry, Will, and Gordon went out in order in the
last of the first inning, only Will managing to hit into
fair territory. Harry and Gordon fanned.</p>

<p>For three innings the contest was a pitchers’ battle.
Tom was in excellent shape, and, although he secured
fewer strike-outs than his rival, managed to hold his
own with the assistance of sharp fielding by his team-mates.
If there were those among the spectators who
had come to scoff at the kind of ball they were to see
they must have been surprised, for both teams played
a practically errorless game until the beginning of the
fourth. And even after that, if there were frequent
miscues, there was enough excitement and suspense to
make up for them.</p>

<p>It was Jensen, the chap who had taken Morris’ place,
who started things going in the fourth. Loring Townsend
had flied out to Pete Robey, making the first out.
With two strikes and one ball on him, Jensen reached
for an out-shoot, found it on the end of his bat, and
deposited it neatly behind Gordon and close to the
foul-line. Chase, the Point shortstop, tried twice to
bunt, and then hit sharply past Pete, and Jensen went
to third. House was over-anxious and went out on
strikes, and Chase got to second. Then Leary waited
and got his base. With the bags all occupied and two
men down, it was up to “Pink” Northrop to come to
the rescue with a hit. The Point coachers were jumping
and shouting like mad, and Tom might have been
excused for some unsteadiness at that juncture. But
Tom settled down, followed Lanny’s signals closely,
and at last, after working two strikes over on Northrop,
caused that youth to hit weakly to third. Will
Scott almost overthrew the base in his eagerness, but
Gordon pulled the ball down in time and the crisis was
over.</p>

<p>Gordon went out, shortstop to first; Way lifted a
high one to second baseman, and Pete Robey faced
Mason with little expectation of faring any better. But
Mason let up for a minute, probably arguing that with
two gone he could afford to take things easy, and
Pete shot a hot liner at third baseman. Caspar Billings
got his hands on it, but it trickled past him, and
Pete was safe. That doubtful error—Dick charitably
scored it as a hit—seemed the signal for the Point to
go up in the air. Mason whipped a quick throw to first
which would have caught Pete flat-footed off the bag
had Loring Townsend been ready for it. He wasn’t,
however, and the ball went past him to the fence, and
Pete, finding his feet quickly, shot to second and then
on to third, beating out the throw by a fraction of an
inch and causing dissatisfaction among the Pointers
over Mr. Cochran’s decision. Lanny, impatiently waiting
at the plate, swung twice in his eagerness to score
the runner, and then waited while Mason teased him
with wide ones. With two strikes and two balls
against him, Lanny out-guessed the pitcher, and swung
against the next one. Shortstop knocked it down but
couldn’t find it again in time to throw either to the
plate or to first, and Clearfield, amidst the excited
whooping of the audience, scored her first tally.</p>

<p>Lanny went down to second on the first pitch, and,
although Houghton threw quickly and well to that
bag, Lanny beat him by a yard. Danny Shores, who
was at bat, had swung and was one strike to the bad
when Mason grimly turned his attention to him again.
Quite a few of Danny’s friends from the factory were
on hand to see him perform, and when, after the third
delivery, he caught the ball squarely on the nose and
sent it streaking just over second baseman’s head, they
shouted themselves hoarse in Danny’s honor. On the
bench, Jack Tappen looked a bit glum. He had visions
of being displaced by Mr. Shores. Lanny came in
without hurrying much, and Danny reposed on first.
Fudge tried to do his share of a hit-and-run play, but
he swung far wide of the deceptive drop, and Danny
was caught at second and the inning was over, with
Clearfield two runs to the good.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm reigned among the spectators on the
stand, and they “rooted” valiantly for Clearfield
throughout the rest of the game. In the fifth the
Point got two men on bases, and was in good position
to score, there being but one out, when Pete Robey
pulled down a liner that had been distinctly labeled
“two bases,” raced to second ahead of the runner, and
then completed the double by making a fine throw to
Gordon. Mason struck out Tom easily in the last of
the fifth, passed Harry Bryan, fanned Will Scott, and
then, with Gordon at bat, caught Harry off first.</p>

<p>Every play was loudly applauded, and the audience
was by this time perched on the edges of the seats.
Again in their half of the sixth Rutter’s Point found
Tom for two hits, and again sharp fielding kept her
from crossing the plate. It was evident, though, that
Tom was less of a puzzle now than in the earlier innings,
and it seemed only a matter of time when the
Pointers would bunch their hits and Dick would have
to credit them with a run or two. You are not to suppose
that Dick was doing nothing but keeping the
score. He was managing that game from the bench
as scientifically as if he had played the game all his
short life. Every batsman got his orders from Dick
before he stepped to the plate, and every coacher was
instructed before he went to the box. And, besides
that, Dick was teaching Harold Townsend how to
score a ball game. In spite of his indifference two days
before, Harold had appeared with a brand-new, black-covered
score-book and a fountain pen. Dick had told
him to put the pen in his pocket, and had supplied
him with a pencil instead. Harold seated himself by
Dick and watched and learned. He made more mistakes
than enough, and his score when finished was a
veritable hodge-podge of misinformation, but he
seemed to get a lot of excitement and fun out of it,
and he really did learn a good deal for a boy who had
theretofore scored an out by placing a huge X opposite
the batsman and a run by marking up an equally
enormous I. When he began to memorize the symbols
for struck out, base on balls, hit by pitched ball,
and so on, he discovered that scoring was not the
simple task he had thought it. About the sixth inning
he gave up trying to keep a detailed score, and contented
himself with disposing of the batsmen with his
X’s and I’s. But by that time the excitement had
grown so intense that it would have required a person
with a much cooler head than Harold’s to keep his
mind on scoring.</p>

<p>Clearfield went to bat in the sixth with the grim determination
to add another brace of runs to her score
and place the game safely away. Dick realized that
Tom was weakening, and that before long the visitors
would find him for some real hits, and before that occurred
he wanted Clearfield to have a sufficient lead
to place her out of danger. Gordon had his instructions
to reach first at any cost. Then Way, who was
a clever bunter, was to sacrifice him to second. Either
Pete or Lanny was to supply the hit to score Gordon.
But plans don’t always carry through. Dick’s didn’t
on this occasion. Gordon hit squarely into Mason’s
hands, and the pitcher tossed the ball nonchalantly to
first for the out. Way bunted down the first-base line,
and managed to beat out the throw. Pete flied to
center field, and Way was held on first. With two
down the inning should have been as good as over,
but Fate took a hand and prolonged it until the bases
were filled, and Dick, watching intently from the
bench, dared to hope that Fudge might for once do
the impossible. Mason had passed Lanny on purpose,
forcing Way to second. Then Danny Shores had
come through with a mild wallop down third-base
line. Caspar had only to touch the base to retire the
side, but his wits must have been wool-gathering, for,
after gathering in the ball on the bound five feet away
from the bag, he paid no attention to Way, dashing
past him hardly out of arm’s length, but hurled the
ball across to first. Perhaps Loring Townsend was
too surprised to realize what was required of him.
At all events, the ball dropped out of his glove, and
Mr. Cochran, who had already motioned Danny out,
had to reverse his decision.</p>

<p>And so the stage was set when Fudge seized his
favorite bat and manfully stalked to the plate, resolved
to do or die. Fudge was right in the midst of a baseball
romance at that time, and only the night before,
writing with his foolscap propped up on his knees in
bed, he had described how his hero, despised and ridiculed
by his school-mates, had gone to the bat in the
last of the ninth and, even while the crowds turned disappointedly
away from the field, had out-guessed the
marvelous pitcher of the rival school and with one
mighty stroke of his faithful bat had turned defeat
into victory by driving out a home-run and scoring the
men on bases. Fudge recalled that as he gripped his
bat and faced Mason, trying hard to appear nonchalant
and undismayed. He wondered whether things
ever happened in real life as they did in stories.
Somehow that brilliant deed of his hero seemed horribly
improbable to-day. Fudge determined to tone
it down a little that evening. A two-bagger would
answer the purpose just as well, and would certainly
sound more plausible.</p>

<p>Dick’s voice from the bench reached him as Mason,
after glancing over the bases, wound up. “Make him
pitch to you, Fudge! It only takes one!” Back and
forth from behind first and third the cries of Harry
Bryan and Gordon rattled. Fudge gripped his bat
tighter yet and glued his eyes to the upraised hands of
Mel Mason. Then the ball, a particularly dirty one,
streaked toward him; Fudge’s heart beat loudly and
he stepped nimbly out of the way, only to hear the fell
verdict: “Strike!”</p>

<p>Fudge looked reproachfully at Mr. Cochran, sighed,
and again faced the pitcher. That ball had come well
across the inner corner of the plate, and Fudge determined
that Mason shouldn’t fool him a second time
with that particular kind of a delivery. So when the
next ball shot forward apparently coming the same
way Fudge held his ground scornfully and prepared
to swing his bat. But the next instant he had forgotten
all about swinging and was sitting on the ground
with both hands clasped to his ribs and an expression
of pained surprise on his face. When he had regained
his breath and the use of his legs, Fudge
thought that the joy of his team-mates was very ill-considered.
It seemed nothing to them that he had
narrowly escaped death at the hands of an infuriated
baseball; they only shouted and jumped about because
a run had been forced in!</p>

<p>Fudge walked painfully to first, reflecting how differently
his hero would have performed. There was
something distinctly humiliating to Fudge in gaining
his base in such a manner, and so deeply did he feel
the humiliation that he quite forgot to heed the warnings
of Gordon, coaching behind the base, and was
surprised to have Loring Townsend, without any provocation,
punch him forcibly in exactly the spot that
Mason’s in-shoot had collided with. That was too
much for Fudge. The pain brought tears to his eyes
and wrath to his heart. He sprang upon the first
baseman with clenched fists, and only Gordon’s prompt
interference prevented trouble. Gordon haled Fudge
away, patiently explaining that Loring had tagged him
with the ball while he had been apparently fast asleep
a yard off the base. The explanation, however, was
not entirely satisfactory to Fudge.</p>

<p>“What of it? He didn’t have to punch me in the
ribs as hard as he knew how, did he?” demanded
Fudge angrily. “What kind of a way is that to play
ball?”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Fudge!” said Gordon exasperatedly.
“Why the dickens weren’t you watching the pitcher?
What’s the good of getting hit if you get put out the
next minute?”</p>

<p>“Good of it!” exclaimed Fudge. “Good of it!
There isn’t any good of it! I just wish he’d
lammed you in the ribs the way he did me! Good
of it!” And Fudge, still muttering, wandered disgustedly
out to center field, one hand pressed to
his side.</p>

<p>The seventh inning passed uneventfully. Tom had
small difficulty with the last three men on the Point
batting-list, and Mason disposed of Tom Haley and
Harry Bryan with five balls apiece, and caused Will
Scott to pop up a foul to first baseman. So the eighth
inning started and Dick began to breathe easier, and
the Clearfield sympathizers were jubilant. After all,
three runs was a good lead, and even if the Point got
to batting Tom in the next two innings, surely Clearfield
could stop them short of three tallies. Thus argued
Dick, and said as much to Harold, who, to-day, at
least, was divided in his sympathies. Harold, having
predicted great things of Mason, was a bit disgruntled
with that youth, and expressed the wish once that
Clearfield would wallop him out of the box. But when
Dick voiced his belief that the game was pretty safe
Harold took exception.</p>

<p>“You wait,” he said darkly. “Here comes Loring
up. He hasn’t done anything yet, and he’s just bound
to. And if he gets on Gil Chase will send him home.
You wait!”</p>

<p>Loring Townsend let two balls go by, failed to size
up the third delivery as a strike, and swung unsuccessfully
at the next. With the score two and two, Tom
sped a straight one over and Loring met it with his
bat and set out for first. He didn’t run very fast,
though, for the hit was a weak one and was bounding
straight at Will Scott at third. But Will made a mess
of that play. He got the ball, dropped it, found it
again and threw hurriedly across the diamond. Gordon
leaped into the air, just managed to tip the ball
with his fingers, and then dashed off on a chase for it
as it rolled toward the fence. When the shouting had
died away, Loring was on second, Al Jensen was
swinging his bat eagerly and impatiently, and Harold
had dropped his score-book between his feet and didn’t
know it!</p>

<p>That was a disastrous inning for Clearfield. Tom
managed to strike out Jensen after that player had
knocked six fouls into various parts of the field, and
managed, too, to hold Loring on second. But when
Gil Chase got the signal from first and trickled the ball
into the pitcher’s box while Loring sped to third, Tom,
with plenty of time to make the out at first, tossed the
ball six feet over Gordon’s head and Loring slid home
with the first run for the Point, while Chase got to
second.</p>

<p>Then Tom had his troubles. His misplay had taken
his nerve, and for a while he went thoroughly to pieces.
Eight batsmen faced him in that inning, and four hits,
for a total of six bases, and five runs were made off
him before he finally managed to strike out Mason.
When that inning was over the game had a different
complexion. Instead of being three runs ahead, with
the prospect of winning a shut-out, Clearfield was two
tallies behind, and defeat stared her in the face.</p>

<p>The home team returned determinedly to the fray,
but Mason was impregnable. In the last of the eighth
not a man saw first and only four players faced him.
In the first of the ninth, Rutter’s Point again started
things with a whoop when Caspar Billings, first up,
singled into left field, took second on Townsend’s sacrifice,
and was advanced to third when Jensen hit past
Will Scott. Then Jensen was caught off first and
House flied out to Shores.</p>

<p>I would like to tell how Clearfield went to bat in the
last half of that final inning and pounded Mason for
enough hits to win the game. But as this isn’t one of
Fudge’s romances I can’t do anything of the sort. As
a matter of regrettable fact, Clearfield stood up to the
plate and watched Mason’s “floaters” waft past them
and listened to the fateful voice of the umpire calling
strikes. Mason ended the day in a blaze of glory, striking
out three men in order and sending his team off
the field victors by the score of 5 to 3.</p>

<p>Harold Townsend, slapping his score-book shut,
grinned at Dick as the last man went out. “What did
I tell you?” he asked gleefully. “Say, you fellows
can’t play ball for shucks, Lovering!”</p>

<p>Dick smiled imperturbably. He had the ability to
smile in the face of disaster, had Dick.</p>

<p>“We’ll try you again some day,” he answered.
“Good-bye, Harold. See you Monday.”</p>

<p>“I may not be home,” replied Harold airily.</p>

<p>But when Dick was accompanying his team-mates
toward the dressing-room a minute or two later, he felt
a hand on his arm and looked around to find that Harold
had followed him.</p>

<p>“Say, Lovering, I—I’m sorry your team got beaten.
And thanks for showing me about scoring, you know.”</p>

<h2 id='c17'>CHAPTER XVII<br/>HAROLD MAKES A PROMISE</h2>

<p>The Clearfield <i>Reporter</i> was quite enthusiastic
over the game in its Monday’s issue. There
had been, it declared, for some time a demand
for a baseball team to represent the city, a demand
which had now been satisfied in the recent formation
of the club which had given such a good account
of itself on Saturday. It was to be hoped that
the organization would prosper and receive the support
of the many lovers of clean sport residing in the town.
The <i>Reporter</i> gave the game almost play by play, indulging
in a wealth of baseball slang and metaphor
worthy of a metropolitan journal. It was quite evident
that the writer had thoroughly enjoyed his task.
He dealt out praise lavishly and was especially complimentary
to the Rutter’s Point pitcher, who, it
seemed, had struck out ten batsmen besides fielding
his position perfectly. Incidentally the <i>Reporter</i> provided
the information that the Clearfield players had
failed to obtain.</p>

<p>“Melville Mason,” said the paper, “gives every
promise of becoming a top-notch twirler, and there is
no doubt a berth awaiting him in one of the big league
teams if he wants it. He has been playing ball for
six years, and last season was second-choice pitcher on
the Erskine College team. He is nineteen years of age.
The Rutter’s Point team is to be congratulated on securing
the services of so accomplished a player. We
are assured by Captain Billings that Mr. Mason receives
no salary.” (“Bet you he’s having his expenses
paid, though,” commented Gordon, when he and Dick
read the <i>Reporter</i> that morning.) “We trust,” concluded
the <i>Reporter</i>, “that a third and determining
game will be arranged between Saturday’s adversaries
and that it will be played on the local grounds, where,
doubtless, a large audience will be on hand to enjoy
it.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t a bad idea,” said Lanny. “We took in
forty-three dollars Saturday. I dare say we could do
even better the next time. And I don’t believe but
what the Pointers would be willing to play here if they
got their twenty-five per cent. again.”</p>

<p>“We might offer them a third of the receipts,” suggested
Gordon.</p>

<p>Dick looked puzzled. “You fellows are frightfully
keen on the financial end of it, seems to me,” he said.
“What’s the idea, Lanny? What are we going to do
with the money we get, anyway? We can’t buy balls
with all of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no harm in having it,” replied Lanny
evasively. “You never know when you’ll need
money.”</p>

<p>“I know when I need it,” said Dick grimly. “That’s
most of the time.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be a bad scheme to sound Billings,”
said Gordon. “You might tell him we’d like to play a
deciding game, and that—er—that as Clearfield is interested
in the series it would perhaps be best to play
here. If Billings kicked, you could offer him a third.
I dare say we’d get a couple of hundred people easily
for the next game, and that would give the Point something
like seventeen dollars.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they’re as much on the make as you
Shylocks,” objected Dick. “Still, I’ll talk it over with
him some day. Perhaps, though, it would be better to
wait and see if they won’t propose the game themselves.
Then we’d be in a better position to make conditions.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he the nifty old diplomat?” asked Lanny admiringly.</p>

<p>“A regular fox,” agreed Gordon. “Work it your
own way, Dick.”</p>

<p>“We can’t play them for about three weeks, anyway,”
said Dick. “We’re filled up with games until
the third of September. I got a letter from Tyson
over in Springdale this morning. He says they’ll play
us there a week from next Saturday if we’ll come over.
What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I say yes, by all means,” replied Gordon, with enthusiasm.
“And I guess we’re all eager to have another
try at those chaps after what they did to us in
June.”</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t be quite the same team, Tyson says,
and they’re calling themselves the Independents.”</p>

<p>“We’ll call them down,” laughed Lanny. “We play
Logan the day after to-morrow, don’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and that reminds me that I must see to getting
notices printed and sent around. I wish you’d
do that, Gordon. I’ve got to go out to the Point in
half an hour. I’ll write out the copy and all you’ll
have to do is to take it down to the printers. They’ll
strike them right off and distribute them for us this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll go there first thing. I’m going to
see Morris for a few minutes this morning. Any little
message I can take from you, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Message? No, not that I know of. Tell him I
hope he will hurry up and get well again.”</p>

<p>“Of course, but—ah!—is there any other member
of the family<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, you run away!” laughed Dick.</p>

<p>If Dick expected to find a chastened and much reformed
pupil at the Point that Monday morning, he
was doomed to disappointment. He gathered from a
remark that the boy let fall that Mrs. Townsend had
kept her promise to speak to him, but Dick doubted if
she had accomplished much. And yet there was improvement
visible. Harold had actually mastered two
of the four lessons and Dick gathered some encouragement.</p>

<p>“I guess we won’t go on with this,” he said toward
the end of the period. “You haven’t studied it, Harold.
We’ll take it over to-morrow. How did you
like the game Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty well! You fellows going to play us
again?”</p>

<p>“Maybe, some day. We play Logan Wednesday.
Do you care to come over and see it? We might have
another lesson in scoring.”</p>

<p>“I guess so. We’re going to play a team from Bay
Harbor on Saturday. Say, Loring says if I’ll learn
to score, I can be official scorer for the team. I guess
I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>“Fine! Then you come over Wednesday, and
we’ll try it again. You did very well the other
day.”</p>

<p>“Did I really? Gee, but there’s a lot to put down,
isn’t there? Caspar’s got six games arranged for the
team. Loring says if I’m scorer they’ll take me with
them when they go away to play.”</p>

<p>That was really no news to Dick, since it was at his
suggestion that Loring had made the offer. But he
pretended to be surprised and interested, and said all
he could to encourage Harold to learn to score. And
Harold became so enthusiastic that he walked over to
the trolley car with Dick, talking volubly all the way.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d make a real try at those lessons to-day,
Harold,” Dick said, at parting. “Won’t you?”</p>

<p>Harold grinned noncommittingly.</p>

<p>But the next morning he went through with flying
colors, and when Dick complimented him he laughed.
“Gee, I can get that stuff all right if I want to,” he
said carelessly. “It’s easy.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you, then?”</p>

<p>“Aw, what’s the use? I’d rather play around, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to go to Rifle Point, Harold?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. I don’t care much. If I do, Loring
will be always bossing me about. I’d rather go somewhere
else, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Loring’s being there will make things easier for
you,” said Dick. “I fancy he’s pretty well liked and
the fellows will be nice to you on his account. But
I’ll tell you one thing plainly, Harold: You won’t
get to Rifle Point this Fall.”</p>

<p>Harold opened his eyes widely. “I won’t?” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Certainly not. And you won’t get there next Fall
unless you buckle down and learn something.”</p>

<p>“Loring said I could!”</p>

<p>“Loring probably thought you were more advanced
than you are, then,” replied Dick. “I’m sorry, Harold;
but facts are facts.”</p>

<p>“Then what’ll I do this Winter?” asked the boy lugubriously.</p>

<p>“How about another year where you were?”</p>

<p>“I won’t! I hate that place! I won’t go back there,
no matter what anyone says!”</p>

<p>“Then you might have a tutor.”</p>

<p>That suggestion didn’t seem to make much of a hit.
Harold scowled for a minute in silence. Then: “Don’t
you think I could get in this Fall, Lovering, if—if I
studied hard?”</p>

<p>Dick hesitated.</p>

<p>“I’m entered, you know,” pleaded Harold. “I
should think I might, Lovering.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you might,” returned Dick grimly, “but it
would mean studying a good deal differently than the
way you’ve been studying, Harold. It would mean
getting your nose right down into the books, putting
your whole soul into it, and giving up a lot of playtime.
Think you could do that?”</p>

<p>It was Harold’s turn to hesitate. Finally, though,
he nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, do you think you <i>would</i> do it?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Sure, if—if you’ll help me!”</p>

<p>“I’ll help you, all right, Harold. But there must
be no changing your mind about it later. If we start
this thing, we’re going to keep it up. If you’ll work
honestly and do the very best you know how, I’ll get
you so you can pass the exams this Fall. What do
you say? Is it a bargain?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” said Harold.</p>

<p>“All right. Hand me those books, please.” Dick
turned the pages and made new marks on the margins
of them. “There; we’ll start off with eight pages instead
of four, Harold. We’ve got to pretty nearly
break all existing records, I guess.”</p>

<p>Harold whistled softly. “Gee!” he murmured.
“Eight pages of that stuff!” Dick looked across inquiringly.
Harold squared his shoulders with the suggestion
of a swagger. “Oh, I’ll do it, all right!” he
said. “You just watch me!”</p>

<p>Wednesday’s game with Logan attracted a smaller
audience to the athletic field than had the Saturday
contest but Tim Turner emptied his pockets of twenty-two
dollars and fifty cents afterward, and as Logan
received only her expenses there was nearly twenty
dollars left. The game was one-sided, Clearfield
winning by a score of 17 to 4. The Logan pitchers—she
used two of them—were easy for the home-team batsmen,
while Tom Haley was hit safely but thrice. Two
of Logan’s runs resulted from errors, Jack Tappen,
who had been reinstated, being one offender, and Gordon
the other. Jack dropped an easy fly, and Gordon
made an atrocious throw to second.</p>

<p>On Thursday Gordon was called to the telephone
after breakfast. It was Louise Brent at the other end
of the line, and Louise informed him that Morris
wanted Gordon to come over there if he could. “It’s
something about the automobile,” explained Louise.
“There’s a man here to look at it, Gordon.”</p>

<p>Gordon promised to go right over, and did so.
What passed in the sick chamber is not to be set down
here, but later Gordon went out to the stable and stood
around while a man with grimy hands and a smudge
on the end of his nose inspected the blue runabout pessimistically
and grunted at intervals. Finally:</p>

<p>“About fifty dollars will do it,” he said, in a sad
tone of voice. “There’ll have to be new spokes set in
that wheel, and them fenders’ll have to be straightened
out again, and it’ll need a new lamp and the radiator’s
sprung and likely leaks and<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Fifty dollars will fix it as good as new?” asked
Gordon.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how good it was when it was new,”
responded the man dolefully. “But fifty dollars’ll fix
it up in good shape, likely.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll tell him, and he will let you know.
Could you start on it right away?”</p>

<p>“Likely I could. I’d have to haul it down to my
place, though.”</p>

<p>“How long would it take?”</p>

<p>“Two or three weeks, likely.”</p>

<p>“All right. Much obliged. We’ll let you know for
certain to-morrow. Fifty dollars is the cheapest you
could do it for?”</p>

<p>“Well”—the man scratched his head reflectively—“maybe
I could do it for forty-five, if I didn’t find anything
else the matter with it. Likely there ain’t.”</p>

<p>They called him “Mr. Likely” during the following
three weeks, for which period of time the runabout
was in his care. Mr. Likely was a born pessimist,
and about every two days he called up the Brents’
house to inform whoever answered the telephone that
“that wheel’s a lot worse’n I thought it was, and’ll
likely have to have a new rim,” or “I got to send out
West for a new lamp, and it’ll likely take two weeks
or more.” But, to anticipate, Mr. Likely made a good
job of it, and in the course of time the blue runabout
was returned to the Brents’ stable, shining and polished
like a brand-new car. By that time the family
had moved out to the cottage at the Point, and it was
Gordon who saw the automobile run into the carriage-room
under its own power and who locked the door
afterward and pocketed the key.</p>

<p>Morris’ leg had knitted so well by the time Clearfield
played Springdale that he was allowed to make
the trip to the neighboring town in a carriage and witnessed
the contest from a position far more comfortable
than the sun-smitten boards of the grandstand.
That was a pretty good game to watch, too. There
was plenty of hitting on both sides, enough errors to
add interest, and several rattling good plays. The
game was in doubt until the last inning, when Clearfield,
with a one-run margin, trotted into the field to do
her best to hold the home team scoreless. Tom Haley
had been touched up for eight or nine hits—Dick and
Harold made it eight, but the Springdale scorer insisted
on nine—and, as luck would have it, the head of
the local batting list was up when the last of the ninth
began. But Tom and Lanny worked together finely,
and, although one runner got as far as second, the
game ended with a spectacular catch by Fudge in deep
center, and Clearfield went home with the ball. The
final score was 7 to 6, and Clearfield derived a lot of
satisfaction from that victory.</p>

<p>The Saturday before she had played Locust Valley,
and had been pretty badly defeated, and the following
Wednesday she had barely pulled out of the game
against Corwin with a victory. Corwin had journeyed
to Clearfield for the contest and the club treasury had
had another twenty-odd dollars added to it. What
puzzled Manager Dick Lovering those days was the
interest displayed by the whole team in the condition
of the exchequer. It seemed to Dick that every fellow
was showing a strangely commercial spirit.</p>

<h2 id='c18'>CHAPTER XVIII<br/>THE LIVE WIRES</h2>

<p>The matter of a new athletic field dragged.
Two more meetings had been held by the
committee, and several trips of inspection
had been made to near-by fields, but no decision had
been reached. In the meanwhile, the surveyors had
shown activity and had run lines through the old field
and even demolished a section of the fence. It was a
question whether the team would be able to use the
diamond much longer, although inquiries failed to
elicit any definite information from the men who were
doing the surveying. The football enthusiasts were
becoming impatient. The prospect of having no better
place to hold practice the next month than an empty
lot somewhere in the neighborhood of the railroad
didn’t please them, and they demanded action.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Grayson, the principal, had left
Clearfield on his summer vacation, and several other
members of the High School faculty were also out of
town, and the committee showed a disposition to await
their return. The hope was several times expressed
that, since Mr. Brent had done nothing with the field
so far, he might postpone cutting it up until next year.
But when the surveyors got to work that hope seemed
idle, and at last a public meeting was called at which
the Athletic Committee was to make a report and recommend
the leasing of what was known as Tilden’s
Meadow for a term of two years. The meadow was
a mile from Clearfield and on the trolley route to
Rutter’s Point, and consisted of about fourteen acres
of fairly level turf. Only sufficient space for a football
field and diamond was to be used, and the rest of the
land was to remain as at present. Mr. Tilden was to
keep the grass cut in return for the hay and was to
receive one hundred dollars a year. There was no
question of having a running track, for the owner absolutely
refused to allow one to be laid out, and that,
at first glance, seemed a great objection to the project.
But, as several of the committee pointed out, there
was no money on hand to build a track even if Mr.
Tilden would allow it. The plan was to make use of
the Y. M. C. A. field, a small enclosure behind the Association’s
building on Lafayette Street, for training
purposes, and hold the meets with Springdale at the
latter’s grounds until Clearfield could secure a track of
its own.</p>

<p>A piece of land sufficiently large for all athletic purposes
was to be had across the river and fairly handy
to the G Street Bridge, but it was next to the railroad
tracks and the mills and the sentiment of the female
members of the High School was strongly opposed to
it. “It would be horrid!” they declared indignantly.
“The smoke and soot from the engines and the mill
chimneys would spoil our dresses and hats. And, besides,
we’d have to walk a whole block through dust up
to our shoe-tops!”</p>

<p>In the face of such weighty opposition the committee
gave way, and the North Side location was abandoned.
Only Tilden’s meadow remained then, and to
that, too, there was much opposition. Many thought
it too far from town; others pointed out that, since it
was unfenced, there would be no way of keeping persons
from witnessing games without paying, and still
others dwelt on the lack of a track. The Athletic
Committee was not to be envied.</p>

<p>Dick talked it over with Louise Brent one morning.
Dick had got into the habit lately of walking over to
the Brents’ in the morning before going out to the
Point. Brentwood was hardly on his direct line to the
car, although it is true that by retracing his steps two
blocks he could get the trolley at B Street and consequently
went only seven blocks out of his way. But
seven blocks, when you have to do it on crutches, is
quite a distance, and doubtless Morris was much flattered
by the interest in his recovery which led Dick
so far afield four or five mornings a week. Dick began
by taking books to Morris, but his library was
soon exhausted, and after that he continued to call just
the same. Of course he always saw Morris, and
equally of course Louise appeared at some period of
his visit. I think that eventually Morris began to
have doubts as to being the chief attraction. At all
events he very frequently left Dick for his sister to
entertain and it wasn’t apparent that Dick mourned his
absence. Louise was good to look at and jolly and
sympathetic, and there was no reason why Dick should
not have been quite satisfied with her company.</p>

<p>On the morning in question, the morning of the
Wednesday following the Springdale game, Morris
had, after offering to race Dick on crutches to the
gate and back and having his proposition declined,
wandered away toward the tennis court, leaving Dick
and Louise on the front steps, which, at nine o’clock
in the morning, were shaded and cool. Dick had
brought up the subject of the athletic field and both
Morris and Louise had had their say. Morris, who
was an ardent football enthusiast and played a good
game on the High School team, had bewailed the fact
that, with practice commencing in another three weeks
or so, no place had been provided for it. Louise
had reminded him gently that the doctor held out slight
hope of his being able to play this Fall and Morris
had briefly and succinctly informed them that the
doctor was an old granny and didn’t know what he
was talking about. When he had gone Louise said:</p>

<p>“You know, Dick, both Morris and I begged papa
not to take the field, but he wouldn’t listen to us. He
said the school could find another place to play on
without trouble. He seems to think that all we need
is a back yard or a vacant lot! I don’t think papa ever
saw a game of baseball or football in his life.”</p>

<p>“It is too bad that he has to cut that field up,” replied
Dick, “but I don’t see any reason why he should
consider us any. He’s been very good to let us use
it so long. And he’s never charged us a penny, you
know.”</p>

<p>“May Scott told me yesterday that her father had
told her that the field might not be cut up after all.
It seems that the mayor or whoever it is that has the
say about such things doesn’t want papa to put the
street through there unless he builds it up to some
grade or other. I don’t understand about it. And
papa doesn’t want to do that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard something of that sort. I believe
the matter is to come up at a meeting this week. It’s
the board of aldermen, I think, who are against it.
It seems that the city has established a new grade
out there and the present grade is several feet
below it. I suppose it means that your father
would have to do a good deal of filling in if he
put the street through. Otherwise the city wouldn’t
accept it.”</p>

<p>“It sounds awfully complicated to me,” said Louise.
“I just wish father would change his mind about
it. I almost wish the—the aldermen would tell him
he couldn’t do it!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they will,” laughed Dick. “But in that
case your father would probably build to the new
grade. So there isn’t much hope, I fear. No, I guess
it’s up to us to move to new quarters. It’s a queer
thing that in a town of this size there isn’t a place
we can use.”</p>

<p>“I know. And that field they’re talking about now
is so hard to get to! Of course, there’s the trolley,
but it’s been such fun to walk out to the games and
have the field so near home. Your team plays a game
this afternoon, doesn’t it, Dick?”</p>

<p>“A sort of a game. We’re going to play a team
called the Live Wires at four o’clock. They’re fellows
in the mills and I guess they haven’t played together
much. It’ll be sort of a practice affair for us.
Tom Haley can’t play and Curtis Wayland is going to
pitch for us. You haven’t been to any of the games,
have you?”</p>

<p>“No one has asked me,” she laughed. “Morris has
been laid up and<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Would you care to go Saturday? We play the
Hemlock Camp fellows. I guess they have a pretty
good team.”</p>

<p>“I’d love to!”</p>

<p>“Then I<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>” Dick paused and frowned. “The
trouble is,” he went on apologetically, “I’ll have to be
on the bench a good deal of the time. Perhaps you’d
rather not go.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind. Just come and see me now and
then, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Really? Then I’ll get Gordon or one of the fellows
to call for you about half-past two.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” asked Louise coldly. “Why Gordon—or
one of the fellows, please?”</p>

<p>“Why—why—because,” stammered Dick, “I
thought probably you’d rather not—That is, I get
along so slowly, you know<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Dick Lovering, you were going to say you thought
I wouldn’t want to walk with you! Weren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, something of the sort. You see<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t see at all,” she responded with suspicious
sweetness. “I shall be very glad to go to the
game with you, Dick, but I refuse to be palmed off
on ‘Gordon or one of the fellows!’”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll be here for you at two-thirty, Louise. It
isn’t very far, after all; only three blocks, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I ought to know,” she said dryly, “since I can
see the top of the grandstand this minute. I may
decide, however, that I want to go by way of the
Common, Dick.”</p>

<p>Dick smiled doubtfully. “We-ell, that’s all right.
I’m game! Now I guess I’d better be getting along.”</p>

<p>“The car just went in,” said Louise. “You’ve got
nearly a quarter of an hour yet. How are you getting
along with your pupil?”</p>

<p>“Finely! I tell him two or three times a week that
we’ll never be able to do it, and he doubles up his fists
and glares at me and wants to fight—almost. He’s
an awfully stubborn little chap and he’s simply made
up his mind that he’s going to get into school this
Fall, and I think he will, too. He will if I can keep
him mad!” And Dick, smiling, went swinging off to
catch the car.</p>

<p>That game with the Live Wires wasn’t as easy for
Clearfield as Dick and Gordon and most of the others
expected it to be. Of course Way wasn’t much of a
pitcher, and that had to be reckoned with, but even
allowing for that the Live Wires showed up a lot better
than anticipated. From a financial standpoint the
game was a huge success, in spite of the fact that the
admission had been lowered to fifteen cents to entice
the mill workers to attend. Attend they did, and
“rooted” so lustily and incessantly for their team that
poor Way was more than once up in the air. Young
Tim Turner played in right field and Jack Tappen
went over to left in place of Way. Tim didn’t do so
badly, since out of three chances he got two flies and
only muffed the third because the crowd hooted so
loudly.</p>

<p>It was quite a tight game up to the fifth inning,
with both pitchers suffering badly at the hands of
the opposing batsmen and both infields guilty of many
stupid errors. But in the fifth Clearfield landed on
Kelly, the Live Wires’ pitcher, and batted around before
they were stopped, adding seven runs to the six
already accumulated. In the seventh the opposing
team returned the compliment and had Way dancing
out of the path of liners and giving bases on the least
provocation. But the infield steadied down then and
only three runs came over for the Live Wires. The
final score was fourteen to eight and Dick, who had
acted as gateman in Tim’s absence, turned over nearly
seventeen dollars to himself as treasurer. So, on
the whole, the game was a success.</p>

<p>When Dick got home after the game his mother told
him that a Mr. Potter, from the <i>Reporter</i>, had called
to see him and would be back about eight. Gordon
came over after supper and was still there when the
representative of the newspaper repeated his call. Mr.
Potter, a wide-awake, energetic young man of twenty-five
or six years, professed his pleasure at finding Gordon
on hand. “Because,” he said as he took a chair in
the Loverings’ little parlor, “I want to talk about another
game of ball between your team and the Point.
I wrote the story of the last game, by the way. I
don’t know whether you saw it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we read it,” said Dick. “It was awfully
good, I thought.”</p>

<p>“I used to do that sort of stuff in Hartford. Well,
say, fellows, how about another game? Anything
doing along that line?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re to play the Point again later. There
hasn’t been any date set yet, though.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s good. I mean I’m glad you’re going
to get together again. Folks who saw that game enjoyed
it. There’s nothing like a game of ball to
bring folks out and give them a good time. Now,
Stevens—he’s my boss on the <i>Reporter</i>, you know—Stevens
wants to get up a rousing good game for the
final one, see? You and what’s-his-name out at the
Point set a date; make it some Saturday, of course;
and let me know and the <i>Reporter</i> will whoop things
up. How would it do if we got the retail tradesmen
or someone to offer a prize? Say a silver cup or a
phonograph or a set of books or something? What
the <i>Reporter</i> wants to do is to stir up some excitement;
see? Get a big crowd there, have the Mayor
throw out the ball, get folks pulling for the home team
and all that sort of thing. Great scheme, eh? What
do you fellows think?”</p>

<p>The boys looked both doubtful and perplexed.</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know, Mr. Potter, that we want to
make a—a Roman holiday of it,” objected Dick. “We
started up the team just to have some fun, you see.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have your fun, won’t you?” asked
the newspaper man eagerly. “Don’t mind winning a
prize and making a little money, too, do you? Look
here, fellows, I’m keen on this. I want to make it go.
To tell the truth, it was my idea. I put it up to Stevens
and he fell for it. This town needs livening
up. Say, honest, we could have the finest sort of a
hullabaloo without half trying!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why not, Dick,” observed Gordon,
thinking a good deal of the money side of the project.</p>

<p>Dick shrugged his shoulders. “Sounds sort of like
a four-ring circus, doesn’t it?” He asked. “Still, I
don’t mind. I dare say it would amuse folks.”</p>

<p>“Amuse ’em! Say, I’ll guarantee to have ’em talking
nothing but baseball in a week! I’ll get ’em so
they’ll be offering fancy prices for the first row in
the grandstand!”</p>

<p>The boys laughed. There was something infectious
in the man’s enthusiasm and the proposed affair began
to loom up as a huge and very amusing lark.</p>

<p>“Do you really think you can do it?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Watch me! I’ll run a story to-morrow on the first
page that negotiations are under way looking to a deciding
game, see? And I’ll hint that there is so much
feeling between the two teams that the outcome is
doubtful. Then<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“That’s hardly truthful, is it?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I can get around that,” was the untroubled
reply. “I’ll say that the folks at the Point
are so certain that their team will win that they’re
willing to offer any sort of inducement for a third
game.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got some imagination,” laughed Gordon.</p>

<p>“Have to have in my business,” replied Mr. Potter
with satisfaction. “You trust me to work up the
excitement, fellows. Stevens says I can go the limit.
We’ll print your score-cards for you, and—that reminds
me. How about a band? Ought to have a band
there, oughtn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Bands cost a good deal,” Gordon objected.</p>

<p>“What of it? Why, say, we’ll have three or four
hundred folks to see that game! We’ll get ’em in from
the country and over from Springdale and Corwin and
from miles around. It might be a good idea<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”
Mr. Potter paused and stared into space a moment.
Then he nodded vehemently. “That’s the scheme!
I’ll get the store-keepers to shut up shop that afternoon.
Maybe Toppan will declare a public holiday.”</p>

<p>Mr. Toppan was the Mayor, and the boys stared in
amazement.</p>

<p>“Why—why he wouldn’t do that, would he?”
gasped Gordon. “Not just for a ball game?”</p>

<p>“Sure, he would, if the <i>Reporter</i> got after him hard.
Say, you see that Point fellow, whatever his name
is, and let me know by day after to-morrow. And
don’t put it off too long. Let’s strike while the iron’s
hot. Folks want to see baseball now. In another
three weeks it’ll be about out of season. Well, that’s
all. Glad to have met you fellows.” Mr. Potter shook
hands briskly. “We’ll give Clearfield a ball game she
won’t forget! Good-night. I’ll see you again in a
day or two.”</p>

<h2 id='c19'>CHAPTER XIX<br/>MR. POTTER GETS BUSY</h2>

<p>When he was gone the two boys looked
at each other a moment and then began
to laugh.</p>

<p>“Rather takes your breath away, doesn’t he?”
gasped Gordon.</p>

<p>“I should say so! And of all crazy stunts<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Get out! It’s going to be a heap of fun! I’m
for it—strong!”</p>

<p>“So I see. But maybe the Pointers won’t care to
take part in such a silly affair.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Why, we’ll offer them twenty-five per
cent. of the gate receipts and they’ll be dead anxious.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! They don’t need any money. What would
they do with it?”</p>

<p>“Do with it? Why—why, what would anyone do
with it? Eat it, of course!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’d like to know. What are <i>we</i> going
to do with it, for instance?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s a lot of things we can do with it, Dick.
We might—might give it to charity or—or—oh, lots
of things!”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re in for it, anyway. I’ll talk to Caspar
to-morrow. I guess two weeks from next Saturday
would be a good date. The trouble is they’ve got a
lot of games arranged and they may not be able to
play us.”</p>

<p>“You tell them what this Potter chap says and
whoop it up, Dick. They can cancel a game if they
want to.”</p>

<p>True to his word, Mr. Potter started the ball rolling
the next morning. The <i>Reporter</i> contained an announcement
on the front page under a big head:</p>

<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>MAY PLAY OFF TIE</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>CLEARFIELD AND RUTTER’S POINT BALL TEAMS</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>NEGOTIATE FOR THIRD GAME—BITTER</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>RIVALRY EXISTS</p>

<p>“Who has the better ball team, Clearfield or Rutter’s
Point? That’s the question that is agitating both
this community and the summer colony at the end
of the trolley. And, if present plans carry, it is a
question that will soon be settled definitely, and, we
hope, to the satisfaction of Clearfield. Negotiations
are to be opened to-day between representatives of
the two teams looking to a third and deciding contest
to be played on the High School field some time
between now and the end of the month. Each nine
has won one game and each nine claims to be a little
better than the other. Over at the Point they are so
certain that they have the champion bunch of players
that they’re willing to do most anything to secure
another game with Clearfield. At this end of
the line there is an equally strong conviction to the
effect that our own aggregation has more than a shade
on the Point team. That’s the way it stands now,
but the <i>Reporter</i> hopes to be able to announce in another
day or two that the managers and backers of
the rival teams have met and agreed on a deciding
game. In which case we predict that those who are
fortunate enough to witness the final battle will see
a struggle they won’t forget in a long time. Watch
for developments!”</p>

<p>Besides that highly-colored effusion there was a
short editorial inside in which the writer extolled
athletics in general and baseball in particular. In
twenty lines the writer alluded to Greek athletes,
Roman games, Christopher Mathewson, Tyrus Cobb,
the American Eagle, the Spirit of Fair Play and
Clearfield. The style of the two productions was so
much alike that Dick and Gordon decided that Mr.
Potter was responsible for both.</p>

<p>“I hope,” said Dick, “that Caspar won’t see this
until I’ve prepared him for it. He will think we’ve
gone crazy!”</p>

<p>As it happened, however, Caspar Billings was much
too busy playing tennis that morning to read the <i>Clearfield
Reporter</i>, and when Dick met him he knew nothing
of Mr. Potter’s activities. But five minutes later
he had found the paper and was chuckling enjoyably
over the story. “It’s great!” he declared. “That fellow
ought to be working in New York. He’s lost
in Clearfield. Say, we’ll have more fun than a picnic
out of this, Lovering. What sort of a prize did he
say?”</p>

<p>“A cup or a phonograph or—or something like
that.”</p>

<p>“Me for a phonograph!” laughed Caspar. “Now,
when can we play? Of course, we’ll go over to your
field. Have to, anyway. How about two weeks from
Saturday?”</p>

<p>“That’s the day I was going to suggest,” replied
Dick.</p>

<p>“That’s all right for us. We had a game scheduled
with a nine from the Ocean House at Traskville, but
they telephoned the other day that they couldn’t make
up a team. That gives What’s-his-name, your
newspaper friend, a fortnight to work up the excitement.
And I’ll bet you he will do it!”</p>

<p>“I guess there’s no doubt about that,” replied Dick.
“That’s settled, then, and I’ll let Potter know. Did I
tell you he wanted to get the Mayor to declare a holiday
and have the stores close?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott, no!” chuckled Caspar. “He’s a wonder.
Say, why don’t you suggest to him that it would
be a bully idea to have the Governor issue a proclamation?
Wonder if the New York stock market will
close, Lovering.”</p>

<p>“It will if Potter thinks of it,” laughed Dick. “Well,
I must be going. I’ll see you again next week and
we’ll arrange about an umpire.”</p>

<p>“<i>An</i> umpire!” scoffed Caspar. “We’ll have to have
two of them for this game; one at the plate and one
on bases. Maybe your friend Potter can persuade
President Johnson to officiate. This is going to be
some game, Lovering!”</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a circus,” replied Dick. “I dare
say they’ll be selling popcorn and peanuts there!”</p>

<p>“Sure to! Well, so long. Tell Potter I’m crazy
about it. By the way, how are you and young Townsend
getting on? Loring told me yesterday that the
kid thinks you’re about the finest thing that ever
walked on—I mean<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Ever hobbled on two crutches,” laughed Dick.
“Well, Harold and I pull together pretty well these
days. The boy is really working like a slave, Billings.
I didn’t think he could do it.”</p>

<p>“He’s a heap more decent than he was the first of
the season. You always wanted to kick him then.
Now he behaves like a real fellow. I suppose he’s
told you he is our official scorer now? He doesn’t do
so badly, either. If you criticize his way of scoring
he looks at you haughtily and says, ‘This is the way
Lovering does it, and he knows!’”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to lay the blame on me, then, if your
scorer doesn’t do you justice, Billings. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>It was Fudge who most delighted in the sensational
aspect of the third contest with Rutter’s Point. Fudge
loved excitement and color and romance, and for that
reason the <i>Reporter’s</i> daily items about the soul-stirring
event filled him with joy. He started a scrap-book
and almost filled it with the amazing articles
that appeared from Mr. Potter’s feverish and versatile
pen. On the morning after Dick’s call on Caspar
Billings the <i>Reporter</i> blazed forth at the top of the
third column of the first page as follows:</p>

<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>THIRD GAME AGREED ON</p>

<p style='margin-left:2em;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0'>CLEARFIELD AND RUTTER’S POINT TO PLAY OFF</p>
<p style='margin-left:2em;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0'>TIE ON AUG. 27—LOCAL CHAMPIONSHIP AT</p>
<p style='margin-left:2em;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0'>STAKE—WHAT CAPTAINS SAY.</p>

<p>What the captains said was that they expected a
close game and didn’t care to predict the winner. At
least, that’s what they really said. In Mr. Potter’s
account they talked whole paragraphs and said a lot
more. Gordon read his remarks with astonishment
and began to wonder whether he had not possibly said
all those things after all!</p>

<div align='center'>
<img alt='' id='i2' src='images/illus-224.jpg' />
<p style='width:348px'>“Dick took Louise to the game on Saturday”</p>
</div>

<p>Dick took Louise to the game on Saturday and
did not have to go by way of the Common. Fortunately,
several of Louise’s girl friends were there
and Dick’s frequent absences from her side were not
so noticeable. Hemlock Camp presented a husky, sun-browned
dozen of young athletes who, led by a clever
captain, played the sort of baseball one reads of. The
Camp’s pitcher was something of a marvel and soon
had Dick’s charges eating out of his hand, to use
Harold’s expression. The contest developed into a
pitcher’s battle in which Tom had slightly the worst
of it and which Hemlock Camp ultimately won by the
score of 8 to 6. If the game was not quite so interesting
as some previous contests, it was at least nearly
free of errors and full of fast, clean playing. Dick
regretted on the way home that Louise had seen a
defeat instead of a victory, but Louise declared that
she had enjoyed it all very much.</p>

<p>“You must come a week from to-day,” said Dick.
“Lesterville is coming to play us a return game and
that will be close and exciting, I think. Would you
care to?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, only we’ll be at the Point then. Still,
I could come over on the trolley, couldn’t I? I’ll get
Morris to come with me. I wouldn’t think of having
you come way over there for me, Dick.”</p>

<p>Dick expressed his entire willingness to go to the
Point and escort her to town, but Louise refused to
allow it. “If you’ll come and see us during the game
it will do just as well,” she said. Dick didn’t think
so, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>The mass meeting to take action on securing a new
athletic field came off that evening in the High School
assembly hall and, after much discussion, the meeting
endorsed the committee’s plan to lease Tilden’s
meadow for a term of two years. The committee reported
that it had a balance on hand of twenty-eight
dollars and forty-six cents and asked for more money.
It was voted to appoint canvassers to visit the students
and the graduates, and, if not enough money was
secured from them, to ask the public to assist. Dick
found himself one of the committee on subscriptions.
Lanny was another. They sympathized with each
other on their way home and were gibed at by Gordon
and Fudge. Fudge offered Dick five cents then
and there, and, his offer being unexpectedly accepted,
had to borrow the nickel from Gordon.</p>

<p>The next Monday the <i>Reporter</i> announced that a
silver cup was to be donated by the merchants as a
prize for the team winning the baseball game and that
it would be on exhibition all next week in the window
of Wetherell’s jewelry store. Tuesday afternoon Mr.
Potter called on Dick with a proof of the poster which
the <i>Reporter</i> was getting out. It was a gay piece of
work in red and green ink and well calculated to attract
the eye. In the center was a picture of a batsman
with a flashing eye and a poised bat. That was
printed in red. The lettering was in green and announced:
“Championship Baseball! Clearfield vs.
Rutter’s Point, High School Field, Saturday, September
third, two-thirty o’clock. Music by Nagel’s Band.
Admission 50 Cents, Reserved Seats 75 Cents. Tickets
at Howland’s Drug Store, and at the Field before
the game.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to use a heavy cardboard stock,” explained
Mr. Potter, “and we’ll strike off a hundred of
’em. We’re going to charge you just what the stock
and the labor cost us and no more.”</p>

<p>“What about the score-cards?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Won’t cost you a cent. I’ve got about a dozen
advertisements and those will pay for the cards. Another
thing we’re going to do is to run an ad of the
game on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of next
week.”</p>

<p>“That’s very kind,” murmured Dick. “You really
think folks will pay seventy-five cents for seats?
Wouldn’t it be better to make the prices fifty cents and
a quarter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, Lovering. We want ’em to understand
that what they’re going to see is a real game
of ball. They’ll pay the price all right. That reminds
me of another thing. How would it do for
you fellows to get hold of a crackerjack pitcher for
this game? You could get one for thirty dollars or
so. There’s Lafferty, of Providence, for instance. I
dare say he’d twirl for you for twenty-five and his
expenses. He’s a corker, too! I’ve seen him work.”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” replied Dick. “I think we’ll stick to
home talent. It seems a bit fairer.”</p>

<p>“Well, just as you say. This fellow Mason, though,
is pretty good, and everyone would like to see the
home team win that game. Better think it over. If
you change your mind you let me know and I’ll attend
to the matter for you. I suppose you chaps are keeping
up practice pretty well?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we practice every day except when there’s a
game.”</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket! You play Lesterville next Saturday,
don’t you? Well, I’ll give a good write-up of
the game on Monday. Got to keep the excitement
going.”</p>

<p>When the newspaper man had gone Dick went out
to the porch and sank into his favorite chair beside
the little table. He was tired and the day was a
scorching hot one. There had been a solid three hours
that morning with Harold Townsend and, although
Harold had done his share without a whimper, it
had been pretty hard for teacher as well as pupil. Dick
closed his eyes and frowned in the green shadow of
the vines. Was Harold going to make it? There
were times when Dick was sure that he would, but
also there were moments, usually when, as to-day, he
was fagged out, when he had his doubts. If Harold
could remember what he had learned when the time
came he would undoubtedly get through, but there was
always the danger that he wouldn’t. Dick sighed. At
least, though, he reflected, his frown fading, he was
doing his honest best for the boy. And—and here
the frown quite disappeared—he had made a nice lot
of money that was greatly needed. He would, he
told himself, have enough by the middle of the month,
when Harold went off to Rifle Point to put the summer’s
work to the test, to pay for a new heater for
the house. That was the most necessary improvement
of the many that were needed. For the last
two or three years the old furnace, never satisfactory,
had quite failed to keep them comfortable in cold
weather. Dick was wondering how much the
hardware man would allow him for it when the gate clicked
and Gordon and Morris Brent came up the path.</p>

<p>Morris still used his crutches, but, as he explained,
the doctor had told him yesterday that he might lay
them aside in another week. “And I’ll be mighty glad
to,” he added. “They’re rotten things to have to get
about with.” Then his eye fell on Dick’s crutches,
leaning within reach, and he colored. “I guess I
oughtn’t to kick, though,” he added hastily.</p>

<p>Dick smiled. “They are awkward if you’re not used
to them, I suppose, Morris. I’m glad you’re getting
on so well. Gordon says you’re going to move to the
Point this week.”</p>

<p>Morris nodded. “Wednesday,” he said. “I want
you and Gordon to come out some evening and have
dinner. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I’d be glad to, Morris. Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll settle on a day with the folks. Mother
told me to tell you she wanted very much to have
you. Louise, too. How would Saturday do?”</p>

<p>“All right, I think. We have a game Saturday, but
I dare say it will be over by five. What time do you
dine?”</p>

<p>“Seven. That’ll give you heaps of time. I’m going
to fetch Louise in to see the game and we can all go
back together.” Morris turned to Gordon. “That
suit you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Finely. Could we get the quarter of six car, do
you think? I’d like mighty well to get a swim before
dinner. Got an extra bathing suit out there?”</p>

<p>“You can take mine. What do you want to do with
this?” Morris held up a book in a red cloth cover.</p>

<p>“Oh, I brought that over for you, Dick,” said
Gordon. “That is, I borrowed it and he
brought it. Thought you might like to look it
over.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” said Dick, accepting the volume
and reading the title rather puzzledly. “‘The Automobile;
it’s Care and Management.’ Er—what<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>” He
looked from Gordon to Morris. “What’s the idea,
fellows? I’m much obliged, of course, but why should
I want to study up on autos, please?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you like to know how to do everything,” replied
Gordon carelessly. “That’s mighty interesting,
isn’t it, Morris?”</p>

<p>“Great!” agreed the other enthusiastically. Dick
still looked puzzled, but opened the book and glanced
at two or three of its pages.</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll have a go at it some time. It does
look interesting. Thank you.” He laid the volume
on the table. “What ever became of that car of yours,
Morris?”</p>

<p>“It’s home. I’m going to sell it. I paid Stacey
the rest of the money I owed him the other day. He’s
a mean little runt. Don’t want to buy it, do you,
Dick?”</p>

<p>Dick smiled and shook his head. “I’m afraid I
couldn’t afford it. It would be sort of handy for me
to get around in, though, wouldn’t it? Look here!”
He viewed the two boys searchingly. “You fellows
didn’t bring me this book expecting I’d get daffy about
automobiles and buy that one of yours, did you?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” disclaimed Gordon hurriedly. “Besides,
Morris has a buyer for that car already. That
is, he thinks he has.”</p>

<p>“All right. Still I don’t see why you think I want
to read up on automobiles,” said Dick. “What’s the
use of knowing how to run a car and grease its joints
if I haven’t got one and couldn’t run it if I had?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t run it! Of course you could run it,” said
Gordon. “Couldn’t he, Morris?”</p>

<p>“Easy! It’s nothing to do. I could show you how
in two days. Why<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>But at that moment Morris encountered Gordon’s
warning look and subsided. Dick stared perplexedly.</p>

<p>“I think you chaps are crazed by the heat,” he said.
“You’ve got automobiles on the brain. What you
need, Gordie, is to get out and play ball. It must
be about time to start for the field, too. By the way,
Harry telephoned over at noon that he couldn’t get
out to-day.”</p>

<p>“Again? I’ll bet anything Harry’s father isn’t keeping
him away from practice. He’s just lazy. I guess
we’d better come down on him with that twenty-five
cent fine!”</p>

<p>“I’ll go over with you and look on if you don’t
mind,” said Morris. “You can’t call me one of the
enemy now, you know.”</p>

<p>“Glad to have you,” responded Dick. “I’ll put this
book inside and we’ll start along. We’ll make a fine
appearance,” he laughed. “Two cripples and a crazy
fellow!”</p>

<h2 id='c20'>CHAPTER XX<br/>MR. BRENT TO THE RESCUE</h2>

<p>A big crowd turned out the following Saturday
for the Lesterville game. As a manufacturing
town Lesterville was something
of a rival to Clearfield and baseball lovers of the latter
place were eager to see the Lesterville players
humbled. By half-past two—the game was scheduled
for three o’clock—the stand was well filled. Dick’s
charges reached the field soon after the half-hour
and began practice. They had, however, scarcely begun
throwing the balls around when there was a commotion
at the gate and Tim Turner was seen excitedly
gesticulating toward Dick, who, near first base, was
watching the team. Dick hurried across to the gate
and found Tim trying to exclude a short, red-faced
man in blue overalls.</p>

<p>“He says he wants to get in to open the big gate,”
explained Tim. “He says they’re going to begin work
in here. They’ve got a cart down the street there
and a lot of men and<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said the man in overalls. “We’re going
to plow in here. Them’s the orders.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t do it now,” exclaimed Dick. “We’re
going to play in half an hour. Those folks on the
stand have paid to see the game. Can’t you wait until
Monday?”</p>

<p>“We cannot,” replied the man emphatically. “Mr.
Brent give me the contract to build the street through
here and me time’s valuable. You’ll have to play your
game somewhere else, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t do that! There isn’t any other place!
Look here, Mr. Brent gave us permission to use this
field and I’m sure he wouldn’t want you to come and
break up our game like this. The other fellows have
come all the way from Lesterville to play us.”</p>

<p>“’Tis no affair of mine, young feller.” The man
tried to push by Dick and Tim, but many of the audience,
attracted by the argument, had gathered around,
and these, taking Dick’s side, stood immovably in the
way. The contractor showed anger. “Now you fellers
let me through here till I open them gates down
there,” he blustered. “If you don’t we’ll break ’em
down.”</p>

<p>“Try it!” said someone eagerly, and a laugh of approval
went up.</p>

<p>“I’ll get the cops here if you make trouble for me
an’ me men! An’ if it’s trouble you’re lookin’ for<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, run away till the game’s over, can’t you?”
asked another of the throng. “Be a sport! What’s
the good of busting up the fun?”</p>

<p>“An’ me losin’ money while you fellers play ball,
eh? What for would I be doin’ that? You leave me
get to the gates.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing, friend! Better back out!”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute,” said Dick quietly. “Will you
wait fifteen minutes, Mister—er<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Me name’s Mullin,” growled the contractor.
“What’ll I be waitin’ fer?”</p>

<p>“To give us a chance to see Mr. Brent about it.”</p>

<p>“I got me contract, an’<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Dick soothingly. “That’s all right.
You’ve got a perfect right to come in here and do
whatever you’ve got to do, but it’s going to put us in
an awful mess. Give us time to find Mr. Brent and
see what he says about it, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“How long will it take?”</p>

<p>“Not long. Say fifteen minutes. He’s probably
here in town. I’ll ask his son. He’s over there in
the stand.” Dick wasn’t at all certain that Morris
had arrived, but he risked it. The contractor hesitated
and finally nodded surlily.</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll give you till three o’clock. Then
I’m goin’ in here, an’ if anyone tries to stop
me<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“I understand. Thank you. Tim, pass the gentleman
inside until we settle this.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait here,” said the contractor grimly.</p>

<p>Dick hurried across to the stand and searched for
Morris. Presently he found him, with Louise at his
side, halfway up the slope.</p>

<p>“Is your father in town, Morris?” he asked anxiously
after he had greeted Louise.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. What’s wanted, Dick?”</p>

<p>Dick explained hurriedly and Morris whistled. “He
may be at his office or he may be on his way out to
the Point. He doesn’t usually stay in town on Saturday
afternoons in summer. I’ll see if I can find him,
though. Only thing is, it’ll take me a long time to
hobble over to his office.”</p>

<p>“I can do it quicker, I guess. Or, hold on! I know!
I’ll get Gordon to go. I’ll be back presently.”</p>

<p>Dick hurried down to the diamond and summoned
Gordon from first base. Practice was still going on,
but in a desultory way, for most eyes had been turned
toward the gate. As quickly as he could Dick explained
what had happened. “He will do it for you if
he will for anyone,” ended Dick. “See if he won’t
call off the workmen until after the game or until
Monday, Gordon. Morris says he may be at his
office. If he isn’t he’s gone home to the Point.
Try the telephone in that case. And try to get back
here by three. That chap won’t wait much longer.”</p>

<p>Gordon nodded and sped toward the gate just as
the Lesterville team came onto the field. He was
in his playing clothes, but there was no time to change
them and he didn’t, as a matter of fact, give much
thought to them. It was five blocks to Mr. Brent’s
office in the bank building, and two of the blocks were
long ones. Gordon did the distance in five minutes
and leaped up the marble stairway to find a clerk just
locking the outer door of the office.</p>

<p>“Mr. Brent?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Gone home,” replied the clerk, looking curiously
at Gordon’s attire and perspiring countenance. “He
left about five minutes ago. You might catch him
before he gets the trolley.”</p>

<p>Gordon raced off again and fortune was with him.
Only a block down F Street he descried Mr. Brent in
front of him walking briskly toward the car line and
tapping the pavement with his cane. Gordon overtook
him just over the Main Street crossing. Morris’ father
turned at the boy’s breathless hail.</p>

<p>“Ah, that you, Merrick? How do you do! Want
to see me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, please!” gasped Gordon. “Mr. Brent,
they’re trying to get into the field, sir, to start work
on it this afternoon. And we’re playing Lesterville
and there’s a big crowd there, sir<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“You mean that Mullin is starting work there?
Well, that’s all right, my boy. I told him to.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, of course, but—but couldn’t he wait until
Monday, sir? We are going to play Lesterville, and
they’re here and there’s a lot of folks paid to see the
game.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it, is it? Why, I don’t know, Merrick.
What does Mullin say? It’s his affair now. He has
the contract for the work, you see.”</p>

<p>“He says he won’t wait, Mr. Brent. But if you
told him to<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“But really, Merrick, I haven’t any right to interfere!”</p>

<p>“It—it’s your field, sir! And you said we could
use it!”</p>

<p>Mr. Brent frowned. “I said you could use it until I
was ready to put the street through, Merrick. Wasn’t
that it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I suppose so,” replied Gordon dejectedly.
Mr. Brent drew his big gold watch from his waistcoat
pocket, snapped it open, frowned at it and snapped
it shut again.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, Merrick, if the city council
hadn’t held me up on that business you’d have lost
your field weeks ago. You ought to be thankful for
that. We’re late on starting that work as it is and
I prefer not to have any more delay. I’m sorry, but
you boys will have to play your game somewhere else.”
He smiled, dropped his watch back to his pocket and
turned toward the car line.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any other place, sir,” said Gordon
sadly.</p>

<p>“No other place? Why, there must be lots of
places! I’ve seen boys playing ball all sorts of places.
There’s a back-lot behind my offices, now. I’ve seen
them playing there day after day—and making a lot
of noise, too. Come now, Merrick, you’re fibbing a
little, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, really,” Gordon answered earnestly. “You
can’t play a real game of baseball on a small lot, sir.
I guess—I guess you’ve never seen one, Mr. Brent.”</p>

<p>“Seen a game of ball? N-no, I suppose not. I
thought all you needed was an empty lot or a back-yard,
Merrick. You say there isn’t any other place?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. We’re going to lease a piece of ground
out toward the Point, but we haven’t got it yet, and,
anyway, it isn’t ready for playing on.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said Mr. Brent sympathetically. “But,
really, Merrick, you ought not to ask me to stop work
in order that you can play baseball. That—that’s a
little too much, eh?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, sir,” acknowledged Gordon dejectedly.
“Only—we thought—maybe a half a day
wouldn’t make much difference<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“A half a day might make a lot of difference. Minutes
count, my boy. You’ll learn that some day. No,
no, I can’t interfere with Mullin. It’s his job. If he
wants to accommodate you, all right, but you mustn’t
expect me to interfere in his affairs, Merrick. Sorry.
I’d like to oblige you.”</p>

<p>Gordon stared at the pavement. Mr. Brent coughed,
turned away and hesitated. “Well, good-day, Merrick,”
he said finally.</p>

<p>“Mr. Brent!” Gordon raised his head, his cheeks
rather red. “Mr. Brent, you said once that—that if
I ever wanted a favor—you<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Hm; yes, I know I did.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I’d like awfully to have you do this
for us.”</p>

<p>“Think that will square accounts, Merrick?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, you don’t owe me anything, sir,”
stammered Gordon, “but you said<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ll keep my word.” Mr. Brent sighed
and looked regretfully down the street. “All right.
Come on, then. I’ll walk over with you and see what
can be done.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Gordon murmured as he fell into
step beside the man. “It—it’s awfully good of you,
sir.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” replied Mr. Brent dryly. “You evidently
don’t value your service to me very highly, Merrick.
It doesn’t occur to you, apparently, that you might
ask a good deal more than this in return for what
you did for Morris.”</p>

<p>“I—I never meant to ask for anything,” murmured
Gordon.</p>

<p>“Hm. More fool you, then!”</p>

<p>There was no more conversation. Mr. Brent
walked briskly and it was but a minute or two after
three when they reached the field. It was evident
that they had got there none too soon, for the big
gates halfway along the board fence were open and
a wagon with a plow in it was drawn partly through
it. That it was not all the way through was due
to the fact that the audience, or a good part of it, had
gathered at the point of attack and was doing its best
to repel the contractor’s men. Shouts and jeers and
laughter came from the scene. At the ticket gate
young Tim Turner, afraid to leave his post of duty,
was peering longingly toward the turmoil. Mr. Brent
strode more quickly.</p>

<p>“Hm,” he said, “I don’t see that I was needed much,
Merrick.”</p>

<p>Mullin, the contractor, very red of face and angry
of eye, was berating the jeering crowd with the rough
side of his tongue. Five laborers, two of them clutching
the bridles of the horses, looked ready and eager
for a fight. At sight of Mr. Brent a cheer went up
from the crowd inside the gates, and Dick, anxious-eyed,
fell back from where he had been vainly trying
to avert trouble. Mr. Brent walked up to the contractor.</p>

<p>“Get out, Mullin,” he said. “Leave it until Monday.”</p>

<p>Mullin scowled hard. “An’ who’ll pay me for the
time I’ll be losin’, Mr. Brent?” he demanded angrily.</p>

<p>“I will,” was the reply. “You ought to have seen,
anyway, that the field was being used. Get your
team out now. I’ll settle for your loss.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, then,” replied the contractor. “All
I wants is me rights. Back ’em out, Jerry.” And
amidst the jeers of the spectators Mullin and his men
retired, the gates were closed again and barred and,
laughing and jostling, the defenders hurried back to
secure their seats before others appropriated them,
leaving Dick and the ball players and a few still
curious ones at the gate. Among the latter was Morris,
and it was Morris who, grinning broadly, came
forward on his crutches.</p>

<p>“Good stuff, dad,” he said approvingly.</p>

<p>Mr. Brent viewed him without enthusiasm. “You
here?” he asked. “Where is your sister?”</p>

<p>“In the stand, sir. I<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“You’d better go back and look after her, it seems
to me,” said Mr. Brent grimly. Morris’s grin faded
and, with a wink at Gordon, he hobbled back toward
the seats.</p>

<p>“We’re awfully much obliged, sir,” said Dick. “If
it hadn’t been for all these people, who had paid to see
the game<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Of course. I understand. You needn’t thank me.
Thank Merrick.”</p>

<p>The players went back to their places, Lesterville
to the diamond to finish her warming up, and Clearfield
to the bench. Gordon was left practically alone
with Mr. Brent, even Dick deserting him. From beyond
the fence came the angry bellow of the contractor’s
orders. “Leave the team here, Jerry,” he
was saying. “We’ll be back Monday, an’ I’d like to
see the man that’ll be stoppin’ me then!”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like to see the game, Mr. Brent,
now that you’re here?” asked Gordon at last. He
ought to be with his team-mates, but he didn’t want to
walk away and leave Mr. Brent standing alone there
by the gate. The latter, who had been looking curiously
at the renewed activity of the Lesterville players,
now glanced at his watch, grunted and nodded.</p>

<p>“I might as well stay awhile,” he replied. “Where
do you pay?”</p>

<p>“You needn’t pay, sir. We’re glad to have you
see the game.”</p>

<p>“I prefer to pay,” was the reply as Mr. Brent
followed Gordon toward the stand. “Here, son!” He
had caught sight of Tim Turner at the ticket gate
and walked across to him. “What’s the price?”</p>

<p>“T-Twenty-five cents, sir,” stammered Tim.</p>

<p>Mr. Brent found two dimes and a nickel among his
change, handed them to the awed Tim and went on.
“Where’s Morris?” he asked. “I’ll sit with him a
few minutes.”</p>

<p>Gordon didn’t know where Morris was, but he
called to Dick and Dick pointed him out. Then Gordon
piloted Mr. Brent up the stand and by dint of
much moving and shoving a place was made for him
and Gordon, muttering his thanks again and getting
a non-committal nod from Mr. Brent, took himself
off.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad, papa,” said Louise gratefully. “It
would have been horrid if they couldn’t have played
the game, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Would it?” Mr. Brent smiled and settled his cane
between his knees. “Who are those young fellows
out there, Morris?”</p>

<p>“Those are the Lesterville players, sir. They’re
warming up for the game.”</p>

<p>“Warming up, eh? Then the game hasn’t begun
yet?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. They’re coming in now, though. It will
start in a minute.”</p>

<p>“Need all this room for a game of ball, do they?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, papa,” replied Louise. “Sometimes
they hit the ball way over by the further fence
there!”</p>

<p>“That so? Well, let’s see ’em do it!”</p>

<h2 id='c21'>CHAPTER XXI<br/>MR. BRENT TELEPHONES</h2>

<p>Perhaps a liking for baseball is latent in every
American. Otherwise how explain the fact
that Mr. Jonathan Brent, who, on his own
showing, had never witnessed a game before in his
life, watched that one with very evident interest? It
was, of course, quite incomprehensible to him at first
and both Morris and Louise had to do a lot of patient
explaining. But by the end of the second inning their
father had a very fair notion of what was going on,
although he still was puzzled by many of the incidents.
As when a Lesterville player tried to reach
second after Will Scott had captured a foul behind
third base and was thrown out by a scant foot. If
it was a foul, argued Mr. Brent, that fellow on first
shouldn’t have left his base. No sooner was that
explained—by Morris, since Louise’s knowledge of
baseball wasn’t sufficient for the task—than Tom Haley
was unfortunate enough to hit the Lesterville right
fielder on the elbow. The umpire waved the squirming,
dancing batter to first and Mr. Brent exclaimed:
“Now, what’s that for, Morris? He didn’t hit the
ball, did he?”</p>

<p>At the end of the fourth inning, when Clearfield
had managed to bat out a two run lead, Mr. Brent
looked at his watch and announced his intention of
leaving. “Guess you can finish this without me now,”
he said. “Mother will be wondering where I’ve gone
to.”</p>

<p>“No, she won’t,” replied Louise. “Mama’s gone to
Mrs. Grey’s this afternoon. Do stay and see just two
more innings, papa.”</p>

<p>“Yes, don’t leave us now, dad,” said Morris. “You
never can tell what’s going to happen in a ball game!”</p>

<p>Mr. Brent frowned, fidgeted and finally leaned back
again. “Well,” he said, “I’ll see one more turn for
each of ’em.”</p>

<p>But at the end of the seventh when, after Lesterville
had gone ahead in the fifth, Clearfield came back
with two doubles and a base on balls and evened up
the score, Mr. Brent was still there and showed no
signs of leaving. In fact, although we have only Morris’
word for it—Louise remaining smilingly reticent
on the point—when, in the eighth, with three Lesterville
players on bases and only one out, Harry Bryan
and Pete Robey executed a lightning double-play that
retired the side without a tally, Mr. Brent’s voice was
to be heard with the others that went up in a shout
of delight! And even Louise affirmed that, in the
tenth inning, when Gordon rapped out the single that
sent Harry Bryan across with the winning run Mr.
Brent pounded approvingly with his cane and declared
that “that Merrick boy was a smart one!”</p>

<p>Ten to nine was the final tally and Dick and Harold
Townsend, who had sat beside the manager during
the entire game and kept a perfectly correct score—barring
a mistake or two quickly set right by a surreptitious
glance at Dick’s columns—closed their score-books
with delighted slams. Revenge is sweet, and
this had been fairly won.</p>

<p>Later on Louise, Morris, Dick, Gordon and the unescapable
Harold journeyed together by trolley car
to the Point and talked the game over with a wealth
of detail and enthusiasm. There was a very merry
party at the Brents’ cottage that evening. Mr. Brent
pretended to have found the game very tiresome and
declared that he didn’t see any sense in grown-up
boys wasting their time on such nonsense, and the
young folks, and Mrs. Brent, too, she having heard of
her husband’s doings, pretended that they believed
him. After dinner Gordon, who had failed to get his
swim in the ocean before, borrowed Morris’ suit and
went in by moonlight. The cottage almost overhung
the waves and the others, on the veranda, watched
him glide in and out of the moon’s path and supplied
him with a lot of doubtless excellent advice on the
subject of swimming. Still later, with Gordon once
more among them, Louise brought out her mandolin
and they sang songs. Attracted by the music, Loring
Townsend and Caspar Billings joined the company
and added their voices to the chorus. Then they talked
some more; of the day’s game, of the next Saturday’s
important contest—and the <i>Reporter’s</i> latest efforts—of
school and a dozen other things.</p>

<p>Dick and Gordon got the last car back to Clearfield,
both comfortably tired and sleepy, and Gordon
walked home with Dick. It was just before they
reached the Levering gate that Dick sprung a surprise
on his friend.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking,” announced Dick, “that there’s
one mighty good use we can put our money to, Gordie.”</p>

<p>“What money?” asked Gordon, with a yawn.</p>

<p>“Why, the money we’ve made on the games. You
see, if we have the crowd next week that Potter thinks
we’ll have we ought to be about two hundred and
fifty dollars in pocket.”</p>

<p>“Easy! Then what?”</p>

<p>“Present it to the Athletic Committee to build a
track on the new field. How’s that for a scheme?”</p>

<p>“Why—er—oh, that’s fine!” But Gordon’s tone
didn’t sound terribly enthusiastic!</p>

<p>Mr. Potter’s prediction came true. By Monday
Clearfield was undeniably baseball-mad. Even middle-aged
and serious-minded merchants discussed the
probable outcome of the third game between the home
team and the Pointers when they met each other on
the street or when they hobnobbed over the Fifty
Cent Merchant’s Lunch at Martin’s Café. The
younger element of the town was wrought up to a
fine pitch of excitement. Those of its sterner sex
who could do so went out to watch the Clearfield
team practice in the afternoon, while the gentler sex,
especially those with High School affiliations, became
wildly partisan. A dozen or more girls, led by Grace
Lovering, got together and manufactured a gorgeous
pennant of purple and white silk, some four feet long,
which, when completed, was hung behind the silver
trophy in Wetherell’s window and, like the handsome
cup, was to be presented to the winner. It was Lanny
who made the suggestion that the pennant was much
too good looking to become the property of the Pointers
and that it should be a perpetual trophy to be
played for each year. The girls approved the suggestion
and the <i>Reporter</i> amended its previous statement
regarding the flag. The trolley company announced
a fare of one-half the usual rate for the
round-trip on Saturday between Clearfield and near-by
towns, and, while Mr. Potter failed to prevail on the
Mayor to declare a public holiday, he did persuade the
shop-keepers to agree to close their places of business
between the hours of two and five. As a matter of
fact, with few exceptions all of them were glad to
do so, for they wanted to see that game as much
as anyone!</p>

<p>There was usually a crowd in front of Wetherell’s
jewelry store that week. In the front row one found
a half-dozen or so of small urchins with their noses
pressed closely against the plate-glass, while behind
them stood a scattering of older persons admiring,
criticizing and audibly reading the engraved inscription
which informed the world that the cup was to
be “Presented by the Retail Merchants of Clearfield
to the <span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span> Baseball Club, Winners of the Clearfield
Championship, September Third, Nineteen Hundred
and<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>.” It was a very attractive affair, that
trophy; twelve inches high, with a fluted base and
two scrolled handles and a polished ebony stand beneath
it. It was generally conceded that the merchants
had done themselves proud. The <i>Reporter</i>
gave a picture of it and a half-column list of those
who had subscribed.</p>

<p>The town was liberally scattered with the red and
green posters on Monday. They glared and shouted
at one from every window. One was not allowed to
forget for an instant that on the following Saturday
afternoon the greatest and most important athletic
event in the history of Clearfield was to be witnessed
at the High School Field for the ridiculously moderate
price of fifty cents—or seventy-five if you
wanted to be sure of a seat!</p>

<p>All this in spite of the fact that from every indication
there would be no field to play on!</p>

<p>Mr. Potter was at Dick’s at a quarter past seven
that morning. He was filled with dismay and wrath,
and some of the things he said about Mr. Jonathan
Brent would not look at all nice in print! At seven-thirty-five
he hurried away to find Mr. Brent. At a
few minutes before nine he was back again, literally
frothing at the mouth.</p>

<p>“Say!” he almost shouted in response to Dick’s
anxious query. “Say! He didn’t say a thing! He
let me talk my head off, that is all he did! I told
him that public opinion would be against him if he
allowed that field to be demolished before the game,
that Clearfield would be up in arms, that the <i>Reporter</i>
would deal editorially with the matter and not mince
its words!” Mr. Potter faltered then.</p>

<p>“What did he say to that?” asked Dick. “He must
have said something!”</p>

<p>“He said,” replied the newspaper man subduedly,
“that he controlled three-fifths of the stock of the
<i>Reporter</i> and he guessed the paper wouldn’t be too
hard on him!”</p>

<p>Dick grinned. “Does he?”</p>

<p>Mr. Potter nodded sheepishly. “Yes, but I’d forgotten
it. After that I had to—well, I had to tone
down a bit. I asked him if it wouldn’t be possible
to delay work on the field until after Saturday. I
told him about all the advertising that had been done
and how everyone was looking forward to the game
and all that, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes? And he wouldn’t agree?”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘Young man, get out!’ Just that and not
another word!”</p>

<p>“Then I guess it’s all off,” said Dick regretfully.
“It’s too bad. Of course, we might play the game at
the Point<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t get the crowd over there. No, sir,
it’s got to be played here. You’re certain there isn’t
another field anywhere?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely certain.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s just one thing to be done. It’s a
last resort and it doesn’t promise well, but I’ll try
it.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>Mr. Potter sank his voice. “See the contractor,” he
said, “and buy him off. For a hundred dollars<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“A hundred dollars!” exclaimed his hearer.
“Where’d we get it?”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, we’ll clear up two hundred easy if we can
pull the game off!”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Dick doubtfully, “but even so I
don’t believe Mullin would dare to do it.”</p>

<p>“Supposing, though, his men went on strike?” suggested
the other with a wink. “He couldn’t help himself
then, could he?”</p>

<p>“N-no, but—I don’t like it, Mr. Potter. It’s pretty
under-hand, it seems to me. After all, we don’t <i>have</i>
to play that game, and<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Don’t have to! You bet you have to! Look at
that cup! Look at all the printing we’ve done; posters,
score-cards, tickets! Look at<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>” But words failed
him and he seized his hat from the table. “Here,
I’ve got to get busy! That Irishman may be
plowing up the field right now! See you later,
Lovering!”</p>

<p>And Mr. Potter dashed off again.</p>

<p>Lanny called up a few minutes later to ask about
developments and after that Tom Haley wanted information.
Dick had no hopeful news to impart,
however. Gordon and Fudge came around just as
Dick was starting for the Point—by way of Brentwood—and
walked with him as far as the corner of
A Street. There Gordon drew Fudge back and
reminded him that three was a crowd. Dick had the
grace to blush.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on,” he said awkwardly. “Don’t be a
silly chump!”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” murmured Gordon sweetly, “but we
wouldn’t think of intruding. Come along, Fudge.”</p>

<p>“Wh-wh-what’s up?” asked Fudge when Dick had
gone on. “Wh-why didn’t you w-w-want to go
along?”</p>

<p>“I can’t explain,” replied Gordon gently. “You’re
too young, Fudge, to hear such things.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Fudge impolitely requested Gordon to
“ch-ch-chase himself!”</p>

<p>Mr. Potter was back again after lunch, mildly incensed
at Dick because he hadn’t been able to find him
before. “Say, there’s something funny about this
business,” he confided, sinking into a chair on the
porch and mopping his forehead vigorously. “I went
over to the field after I left you this morning and
there wasn’t a thing doing. You said Mullin left his
wagon there, didn’t you?” Dick nodded. “Well, it’s
gone now. I tried to get him on the ’phone and his
wife said he was out of town. What do you make
of that?”</p>

<p>Dick shook his head. “I don’t know. Maybe Mr.
Brent thought better of it after you left him. You’re
certain the wagon was gone?”</p>

<p>“Sure! I walked all around the field and went inside.
There wasn’t a scratch there and there wasn’t
even a wheelbarrow in sight outside. Now, what does
that mean? I’d call the old chap up and ask him,
only—well, frankly, Lovering, I’m afraid I’ll lose my
job! I suppose you wouldn’t want to get him on
the telephone and ask him about it?”</p>

<p>“I’d a lot rather not,” owned Dick. “I guess I’m
just about as scared of him as you are.”</p>

<p>“But he can’t hurt you! With me it’s different. If
he ever tells Stevens I went to his office and read
the riot-act to him Stevens will hand me a ticket and
a week’s pay!”</p>

<p>“I guess Gordon would do it if I asked him to,”
said Dick after a moment’s thought. “I’ll see if I
can find him on the ’phone.”</p>

<p>But Gordon was not at home. Mrs. Merrick said
she believed he had gone somewhere with Fudge.</p>

<p>“I’ll see him at four o’clock,” said Dick. “I told
the fellows we’d meet at the field and hold practice
if we could find room there. I don’t see why—Excuse
me a minute, will you?”</p>

<p>The telephone had rung and Dick took his crutches
again and once more swung himself into the house.</p>

<p>“This you, Dick?” asked the voice at the other end
of the line. “This is Morris. Say, Dick, I had a
funny message from my dad a few minutes ago. He
telephoned from the office. ‘You can tell that Merrick
boy,’ says he, ‘that he can go on and use the field.
Tell him to come and see me Wednesday. I’m going
to Hartford at three and I’ll be back Wednesday
noon.’ That’s great, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Fine! Do you suppose he means that we can have
it until after Saturday, Morris?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Anyway, it sounds so, doesn’t it? And his
wanting to see Gordon makes it look that way, too.
I’ve been trying to find Gordon, but his mother says
he’s out somewhere. If you see him get him to call
me up here at the Point, Dick.”</p>

<p>“I will. That’s bully news, Morris, and your
father’s a brick! I’ve just been talking with Mr. Potter.
He’s all het up about it,” laughed Dick. “He
will be tickled to death! So long, Morris, and thanks.
I’ll tell Gordon when I see him about four.”</p>

<p>Dick hung up the receiver and went back to the
porch to be confronted by Mr. Potter’s eager and
questioning countenance.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help hearing what you said,” he exclaimed.
“Has he come around?”</p>

<p>“I think so. He telephoned Morris to tell Gordon
that we could go on and use the field and that Gordon
was to call and see him on Wednesday. He’s going
to Hartford this afternoon. I guess it’s all right.”</p>

<p>Mr. Potter heaved a vast sigh of relief. “Well, I
hope so. I want to put this thing through now that
I’ve started, Lovering. I’ll breathe easier, though,
when I hear for certain. If he changes his mind again
about Wednesday we’ll be in a worse pickle than
ever!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he will, Mr. Potter. I guess he’s concluded
to let us use the field. If he hadn’t Mullin
would be at work this minute. If I were you, though,
I’d hear what Mullin says.”</p>

<p>“I will, just as soon as he gets home.” Mr. Potter
looked at his watch and jumped to his feet. “I must
be off. Say, that’s a load off my mind, all right! Now
I’ll go ahead and close with Nagel for the music. He
wants twenty dollars for two hours. I guess that’s
fair enough. By the way, can you let me have your
batting-list to-morrow? We want to print those score-cards
about Wednesday. And, say, if you hear anything
more call me up at the office. If I’m not there
they’ll take a message. Bye!”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” mused Gordon when Dick met him at
practice an hour later, “what he wants to see me
about.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s about the field, I suppose,” said Dick.
“Don’t look so frightened, Gordie. He won’t eat
you!”</p>

<p>Gordon laughed and then shook his head ruefully.
“I know, but that man scares me to death. I don’t
know why, either. He’s always been as nice as pie
to me. I guess it’s his eyes. They sort of go right
through you and come out the other side!”</p>

<p>There was a big crowd of onlookers there that afternoon
and the Clearfield Baseball Club performed to
enthusiastic applause. Dick had sought to arrange
a game for Wednesday afternoon but had found no
team that could or would play them, which was a
matter of regret since Clearfield needed harder practice
than it could get without an opponent. Rutter’s
Point, which had been playing two games a week
steadily, was to meet Logan on Wednesday at the
Point.</p>

<p>“I wish we had got them,” said Dick. “They’d give
us just about the sort of a game we need.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” suggested Jack Tappen, “they’d swap
dates with us if we asked them. They won’t get any
money at the Point, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they will,” piped up Harold, who had come
over to watch practice at Dick’s invitation. “They
pass a hat around and sometimes get ten or twelve
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Anyway, I don’t care to do a thing like that,” said
Dick. “It wouldn’t be exactly square, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what!” exclaimed Harold.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Jack. “You’re full of information,
kid.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harold, pausing long enough to regard
Jack with a look of disdain, “why don’t you
play them in the morning?”</p>

<p>“By jove!” said Lanny.</p>

<p>“‘Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings!’”
murmured Jack. “Kid, you’re all right!”</p>

<p>“We might,” pondered Dick. “They’re coming
over anyway, and I dare say they’d just as lief come
in the morning as later. I’ll get hold of that captain
of theirs this evening and see what he says.”</p>

<p>“Tell ’em we’ll pay their fares both ways,” suggested
Will Scott.</p>

<p>“Sure thing; and buy them a lunch,” agreed Way.</p>

<p>“They’ll do it,” said Gordon. “Make the game
at ten-thirty, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Better say eleven. They could hardly get over
here before half-past ten. Well, I’ll get after them
as soon as I get home. Harold, you are a youth of
ideas!”</p>

<p>And Harold smiled proudly.</p>

<h2 id='c22'>CHAPTER XXII<br/>GORDON BRINGS GOOD NEWS</h2>

<p>That was just about the busiest week for
Dick that he ever remembered spending. In
the mornings there was usually Mr. Potter
to be seen and Mr. Potter’s newest schemes to be
considered. And, after that, for nearly three hours,
he and Harold shut themselves up in the latter’s
room at the hotel and worked like a couple of galley
slaves. All the hard work wasn’t the younger boy’s,
either, for Dick had to do a lot of studying in order
to maintain with dignity his rôle of teacher. It would
never have done to have allowed Harold to catch him
napping! The younger boy’s capacity for study was
a revelation to Dick, and his progress a source of
great satisfaction. By the end of that busy week
Dick could, and did, assure himself that the battle
was won! That unless Harold had an almost total
lapse of memory when he was put through examinations
he could not fail to enter Rifle Point. Of course
cramming is not the best means of learning, and much
of what Harold learned that summer he was bound
to forget later, but Dick hoped that the forgetting
would not come until he had passed examinations.
Mrs. Townsend almost wept with joy and relief when
Dick told her that he firmly believed they had succeeded
in what had seemed not many weeks ago an
impossible task, and her gratitude, or the expression
of it, embarrassed Dick horribly.</p>

<p>After he returned from the Point each day just in
time for dinner at one o’clock Dick had two hours
to himself. Or he had unless the indefatigable Mr.
Potter broke in upon him to breathlessly announce
progress or to present a problem to be solved. At
four there was practice at the field. In the evenings
Dick very often had to go over the next day’s lessons,
a task more often than not interrupted by the
visit of Gordon or Lanny or Fudge or, possibly, all
three. Tuesday evening not only that trio but Morris
Brent as well descended upon him. Morris had at
last discarded his crutches and walked with an almost
imperceptible limp. The doctor assured him that
the limp would leave him in a week or so, and Morris,
an ardent football enthusiast, was already talking punts
and drop-kicks.</p>

<p>Since Logan had readily consented to play a game
with Clearfield at eleven o’clock the next morning,
and since Dick’s services would be needed at the field,
the usual morning lesson at the Point had been postponed
until Wednesday evening. Dick hadn’t the
heart to ask Harold to give up seeing Logan and Rutter’s
Point play in the afternoon. And so when the
visitors announced their presence that evening by a
series of loud whistles from the gate Dick closed his
books regretfully, knowing that he would have to
sit up very late after his callers had gone.</p>

<p>They sat out on the porch and talked of many things
while the crickets and katydids chirped and fiddled in
the darkness. It had been decided that Tom was to
pitch only three innings of the morning’s game and
that Way was to finish out. This was in order to keep
Tom fresh for the big game on Saturday. To equalize
matters, Logan was to pitch her third baseman
against Clearfield so that she might save her regular
box artist for the afternoon contest. They discussed
this and other features of the morrow’s battle, and
then, as they always did sooner or later, reverted
to the Saturday’s event. Fudge was filled with
excitement these days and stuttered like an
empty soda fountain whenever the subject was
broached.</p>

<p>“Jordan and Fillmore’s window is f-f-f-full of flags
and p-p-pennants,” announced Fudge. “It looks s-s-s-swell!”</p>

<p>“It’s sort of one-sided, though,” said Lanny. “They
ought to put up some Point flags too.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose there are any,” answered Gordon.
“They haven’t any regular color over there, have
they?”</p>

<p>“Sure; blue and yellow. It’s a funny combination,
but some of the girls out at the Point have made some
flags and they say they look mighty well.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Potter told me to-day,” remarked Dick, “that
he’s hired four kids to sell flags at the field. He got
Jordan and Fillmore to make up two hundred of them
for him. He can certainly think of more things to
do!”</p>

<p>“Those are probably the flags they have in their
window,” suggested Lanny. “What are they like,
Fudge?”</p>

<p>“J-J-Just like the High School flags, only they have
just a C instead of C. H. S. on them. They’re s-s-swell!”</p>

<p>“You told us that before,” said Gordon. “I guess
Potter will be stuck with about a hundred and fifty of
his two hundred.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he will. Say, why didn’t we think
of doing that, fellows? We might have made a lot
of money.” And Lanny looked almost accusingly at
Dick.</p>

<p>“I don’t see that we need any more money,”
replied the manager. “We’ll have so much as it is that
we’ll have to open a bank account. I’m scared to
death to have it in the house.”</p>

<p>“How much have we got now?” asked Lanny.</p>

<p>“Over a hundred, and all bills paid. Did Gordie tell
you my scheme for using it, Lanny?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the unenthusiastic reply. “But I don’t
believe<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“It’s a dandy scheme,” interrupted Gordon quickly.
“We—we’ll talk it over some day, after this game’s
over with. No use trying to think of anything else
right now. I say, Dick, have you studied that automobile
book any?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t had a minute’s time. No hurry, is
there? I’ve about decided to wait another month or
so and get one of the next year’s models. I’ve already
got almost two dollars laid by toward it.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t buy a cheap car,” laughed Lanny. “Get—get
one like Morris’s.”</p>

<p>The succeeding silence was broken hurriedly by
Morris. “Yes, but don’t break a leg with it,” he exclaimed.
Lanny and Gordon and Fudge laughed
loudly and Dick stared at them through the half-darkness
of the porch with a puzzled look on his face.
He had seen Gordon reach out and aim a kick at
Lanny’s shin and, judging from Lanny’s pained contortions
immediately afterward, Dick fancied that
Gordon’s aim had been true. For over a week now
Dick had been aware that some project was under
way by the others that he was purposely excluded
from. What it was he couldn’t imagine, but that it
had to do with automobiles seemed certain. More
than once he had seen warning glances sent from one
fellow to another and quite often a remark had been
cut short at his approach. That the mystery concerned
him particularly Dick did not suspect,
however. And just now he had too many things
on his mind to allow of much consideration
of it.</p>

<p>“You really ought to read that book, though,” said
Gordon. “Oughtn’t he, Morris?”</p>

<p>Morris agreed emphatically, and Fudge said, “You
really ought, Dick!” and Lanny murmured something
about it being well to know such things.</p>

<p>“Look here,” exclaimed Dick, half laughing, half
in earnest, “if you fellows don’t quit nagging me to
read that book I’ll—I’ll pitch it out the window! What
the dickens do I want to learn about running an automobile
for? Are you fellows dippy?”</p>

<p>There was complete silence until Lanny said: “You
never can tell, Dick, when you might be called on to—to
profit by the—er<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” responded Dick with sarcasm.
“Most any old day I might get the offer of a
chauffeur’s job! Or maybe you fellows are going to save
up for Christmas and buy me a taxicab!”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” said Lanny weakly. Fudge giggled.
Gordon had a fit of coughing. Morris became intensely
interested in the stars seen through the vines.</p>

<p>“You’d make a peach of a chauffeur, Dick,” laughed
Gordon finally.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why—er—just because,” replied Gordon flatly.
“Say, I’ve got to be going home, fellows. You coming
my way?”</p>

<p>The others displayed a most uncomplimentary enthusiasm
for departure, and after they had clicked
the little gate behind them Dick could hear them talking
in low and excited tones as they passed up the
street. He shook his head as he moved his crutches
toward the doorway.</p>

<p>“Either they’re all crazy,” he murmured, “or they’re
trying to work some sort of a game on me. I wonder
what it is.”</p>

<p>But he didn’t wonder long, for the morrow’s lessons
awaited him upstairs and when he had finished
with them he was too tired and sleepy to wonder
about anything.</p>

<p>Clearfield and Logan played only six innings the
next forenoon. The visitors arrived nearly twenty
minutes late and the game dragged. There was a
lot of hitting and each team seemed determined to
make more errors than its opponent. Curtis Wayland
and the rival pitcher were pretty evenly matched and
it was only because Clearfield, in spite of her endeavors,
failed to tally as many errors as Logan that
the home team stood three runs ahead when the contest
was called to allow the visitors to snatch some
dinner before going over to the Point. Dick couldn’t
derive much satisfaction from that game, and was
inclined to be downcast until, just before supper time,
Harold telephoned over to him that the Point team
had won by only two runs. After that Dick cheered
up and saw things more brightly. And then, scarcely
two minutes later, came Gordon with his news.</p>

<p>“We’ve got the field, Dick!” he cried from the sidewalk
even before he reached the gate. “Mr. Brent
is going to give it to the school! It isn’t going to be
cut up!”</p>

<p>“Give it to the school!” echoed Dick amazedly.</p>

<p>“Yes! Isn’t that fine and dandy?” Gordon
sprawled into a chair on the porch and fanned himself
vigorously with his straw hat. “He’s having a
deed made out and just as soon as Mr. Grayson comes
back it will be ours. Morris is giving it.”</p>

<p>“Morris! How can he give it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I mean Mr. Brent is giving it in Morris’s
name. It’s to be called Brent Field. And he almost
as much as promised to build us a big new grandstand
some day! Isn’t he—isn’t he a corker?”</p>

<p>“But—but what—how<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>Gordon laughed excitedly. “I guess it was seeing us
play the other day that did it. He said he guessed
as we got so much enjoyment out of the field we ought
to have it. He didn’t get home until nearly half-past
four and I called at the office three times before
I found him. I thought the first time that I’d sneak
off and not come back. But I’m glad I did, though. I
was scared to death when I went in. But he was as
nice as pie. He asked a lot of questions about baseball
and football and the Athletic Committee and the
field we talked of getting, and then—then—well, then
he asked me if I thought the fellows would like to
keep the field. And I said of course they would. And
then he said he had decided to make the school a present
of it if—if I wanted him to.”</p>

<p>“If you wanted him to!” exclaimed his hearer.</p>

<p>Gordon nodded. “You know he told me the time
I—the time I was with Morris when he got hurt that
if I wanted anything I was to ask him for it. So the
other day when Mullin was going to plow up the field
I—I sort of reminded him of what he had said and
told him I’d like him to let us use the field that day.
I didn’t tell you, but that was how we got it. Well,
to-day he said I hadn’t made the most of my
opportunity, or something like that. He said I should have
asked for the field outright if I wanted it. ‘Why didn’t
you?’ he asked. Gee, I didn’t know what to say, so I
just looked silly, I guess, and grinned. Then he said
how grateful he and Mrs. Brent were for what I did
for Morris that day and that if I’d asked him then
for the field he’d have given it to me; I mean to the
school. So I said, ‘Yes, sir, if you please,’ and he
laughed and said: ‘All right, Merrick. I’ll have the
deed made out to-morrow. But I want you to understand
that it is Morris who is giving the field and
not me. He’s one of you and the gift will come better
from him.’ And then he shook hands with me and
walked ’way out to the stairs with me! And—and
say, Dick, isn’t it <i>great</i>?”</p>

<h2 id='c23'>CHAPTER XXIII<br/>MR. BRENT THROWS A BALL</h2>

<p>If that Saturday had been manufactured to Mr.
Potter’s order it couldn’t have been finer. There
was a bright blue sky overhead and not a cloud
bigger than a handkerchief to be seen. A westerly
breeze, bearing the first hint of Autumn, cooled the
ardor of the sun. Clearfield had a gala look as soon
as the shades at the store windows were drawn in
the morning. Touches of purple appeared everywhere.
By ten o’clock the downtown streets began to show
the incursion of visitors from the neighboring villages
and even from the country and the stores reaped
a small harvest. At noon Common Street in the vicinity
of the field was well lined with sidewalk vendors
of peanuts and popcorn, lemonade and soft drinks,
while in a vacant lot near-by a hustling gentleman with
a blue-black mustache and a yellow corduroy coat had
set up a merry-go-round whose strident organ ground
out a repertory of four tunes monotonously from
forenoon to midnight. Small boys with purple pennants
bearing white C’s importuned passers to show
their patriotism at the expense of a quarter of a dollar
and other small boys flaunted copies of the morning
<i>Reporter</i>. “Line-up of to-day’s game! Here you
are! <i>Reporter!</i> Only two cents!”</p>

<p>The reserved seat tickets on sale at Howland’s gave
out at eleven o’clock, and at twelve, after a hasty conference
over the telephone with Dick, Mr. Potter had
a load of lumber and four carpenters at the field
erecting sixty extra seats.</p>

<p>At one, even before the last nail had been driven,
the drug store reported that they had again sold out.
“Sell fifty more,” telephoned Mr. Potter, “and mark
them ‘Bench!’” Then he hurried to Odd Fellows’
Hall with a moving-van and transferred ten settees
from there to the ball grounds and placed them in
a double row all along the third base line. After
that he threw up his hands.</p>

<p>Shortly before noon a blue runabout, with its brass
glistening radiantly and its newly varnished surface
reflecting back the sunlight, stopped in front of the
carriage gate at the field and honked its horn. After
which Gordon, who rode beside the operator, jumped
to the ground, climbed the fence and unbarred the
gates from inside. Then Morris drove in, Gordon
dropped the bar back in place and climbed into the
car again and the blue runabout ambled across the
white foul line and stopped a few feet from the home
plate, with its glistening radiator pointed at the grandstand.</p>

<p>“That’s my last ride in her,” said Morris regretfully
as he got out.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Gordon. “He may give
you a lift some time.”</p>

<p>Morris smiled. “I meant the last time I’d run her,”
he amended. “Gee, but I kind of hate to give her up,
Gordon.”</p>

<p>“She’s a nice little car,” replied the other, “even if
she did try to break your neck for you. And she
certainly looks dandy. And she runs as well as ever,
doesn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Better, it seems to me. I suppose she’s getting the
stiffness out of her. Well, we’d better hike along
to dinner. You’re sure your mother won’t mind having
me, Gordon?”</p>

<p>“She expects you. I telephoned I was bringing you.
Come on.”</p>

<p>It was long before two o’clock when the crowd began
moving toward the field. Stewart, the liveryman,
ran carriages from the station to the entrance and
did a good business. At a few minutes before two
Gordon and Dick and Lanny arrived. Mr. Potter was
already on hand, instructing the two boys who were
acting as ushers and keeping an eye on the amateur
ticket seller at the gate. Tim Turner stood inside
and took the tickets, dropping them into a tin box
and looking as professional as you please. Dick’s
gaze found the automobile the instant he was inside
and he stopped short and stared at it. And no wonder,
for a blue runabout placed imposingly in the center
of a baseball diamond is about as incongruous a
sight as one often sees.</p>

<p>“Wh-what the dickens!” gasped Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, that?” said Gordon. “That’s the car that
Morris just sold. Looks pretty well, doesn’t it? Come
on in the dressing-room.”</p>

<p>“But what’s it doing there?” asked Dick. “Whose
is it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose someone left it there. Gee, Dick, look
at the crowd here already! We’ll have to have groundrules
if they keep coming!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so. But—that car! It can’t stand
there, Gordie!”</p>

<p>“Of course not. It’ll be out of the way by the time
we’re ready to practice, I dare say. There’s Tom.
Come on. We’d better get changed. It must be almost
two.”</p>

<p>Dick followed them into the dressing-room without
further remarks, but it was plain to be seen that
the incident of the misplaced automobile was
occupying his thoughts. Most of the team had arrived and
in another moment Dick found enough to attend to
and talk about without further bothering his head
with the blue runabout. The Point team came in a
few minutes later and then there was a fine confusion
and noise in there. Everyone was in the best of
spirits and there was no sign of animosity between
the opponents. One might have thought, were it not
for the difference in costumes, that the two dozen or
so fellows were team-mates rather than rivals. It was
the first time that most of the Clearfield fellows had
seen the Rutter’s Point players in their new togs, and
they had to acknowledge that the white suits and blue-and-yellow-striped
stockings were very attractive.</p>

<p>Of course Harold was there, score-book under arm,
following Dick around closely. And Morris, too, in
his capacity of honorary member of the visiting nine.
Probably he would have been welcome in any case, for
to-day was to witness the formal transfer of the field,
in Morris’s name, from Mr. Brent to the High School.
Mr. Grayson, who had arrived home the day before,
was to attend and Morris was to deliver the deed to
him, as a sort of added attraction. Morris, however,
didn’t appear oppressed by his importance, a fact
which his companions were quick to notice and approve.</p>

<p>At five minutes past the two teams went out to the
diamond, and as they appeared, the band, massed fourteen
strong in front of the grandstand, broke into the
triumphal strains of “See the Conquering Hero
Comes.” By that time the stand was filled to overflowing,
the extra seats were well occupied and the
settees sprinkled, while around the diamond what
looked to the startled gaze of the players to be a vast
assemblage sat or stood.</p>

<p>“Jumpin’ Jupiter!” muttered Fudge, his eyes very
big and round. “S-s-s-say, Jack, I won’t b-b-b-be able
to c-c-catch a thing!”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll all have stage-fright,” replied Jack
Tappen, with a rather nervous laugh. “Who would
have thought all this crowd would have come? And
look at the gate! They’re still coming, Fudge!”</p>

<p>“G-g-guess I’ll s-s-s-sneak home,” said Fudge.</p>

<p>Dick was frankly puzzled. Instead of trotting into
the field to begin practice, his charges were lounging
over toward the plate, and with them went the Point
team. Then Dick’s eyes fell on that blue runabout
again, and he frowned and followed the players, who
by this time had gathered about it. Harold, who
never allowed Dick to get more than six feet away
from him, went, too.</p>

<p>“Someone will have to get that car out of here,”
announced Dick impatiently. “Whose is it, anyway?”</p>

<p>As the band, which had been blaring forth a
twostep, stopped suddenly at a signal from Gordon, just
in the middle of Dick’s pronouncement, he finished it
in a voice which, owing to the silence, was audible
halfway to the outfield. A ripple of amusement came
from the nearer seats. Dick, embarrassed by events
and by an impending something that he sensed, looked
blankly about the grinning faces.</p>

<p>“Wh-what’s the matter?” he faltered, appealing to
Gordon.</p>

<p>Gordon cleared his throat and took a step forward.
The rest of the players shuffled into the semblance of a
half-circle behind him and about the blue car. The
audience, none of them in the secret but all suspecting
interesting developments, grew very still.</p>

<p>“Dick,” began Gordon, very red of countenance
and nervous of manner, “we—that is<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Go to it, Gordie,” murmured Lanny encouragingly.
Gordon took a deep breath and another start:</p>

<p>“The Clearfield Baseball Club, in recognition of
your services as manager and—and in token of its
esteem and<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Respect and esteem,” prompted Lanny, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p><span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>“Respect and esteem,” corrected Gordon, who
had prepared his speech with much care and had now
pretty well forgotten it, “desires to present to you this
automobile, in the hope—er—in the hope<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“That it will provide<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>That it will provide both comfort and pleasure.
It is with much—it is with much<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>Gordon looked imploringly at Lanny, but Lanny’s
gaze was fixed blankly on space. He, too, had forgotten
the lines! Fudge gave way to his nervousness
and giggled. Gordon waved his hand toward the
car. “And we hope you’ll like it,” he ended breathlessly.</p>

<p>There was an instant’s silence, and then came a joyous
screech from Harold. That was the signal for
much hand-clapping and other evidences of applause
from the spectators who, although Gordon’s speech
had not been audible to them, had by this time gathered
that someone was being presented with the natty
blue automobile. Dick, rather white of face, smiled.</p>

<p>“I—I<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>” he began. Then he faltered. When he
went on his voice was husky. “Thank you, fellows,”
he said. “I don’t see why you did it, but—but I appreciate
it more than I can say. And—I can’t make
a speech, so I’ll just say thank you and—you’ll have
to understand that it means a lot more than I can put
in words!”</p>

<p>Then they cheered quite madly, being heartily glad
to be over with the embarrassment, and flocked around
him and shook hands just as though they hadn’t seen
him for months!</p>

<p>“‘It is with much pride that we offer this small
token,’” said Lanny explosively in Gordon’s ear.
Gordon laughed derisively.</p>

<p>“What’s the good now?” he demanded. “Why
didn’t you say that two minutes ago? You’re a fine
one to help a fellow!”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you remember it yourself?” asked
Lanny, in an injured voice. “Gee! You wrote it,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Morris jumped into the driver’s seat of the car and
Dick, impelled by friendly hands, climbed in beside
him. Will Scott spun the crank, the engine purred,
and, to the cheers and laughter of the fellows and
the enthusiastic applause of the spectators, the blue
runabout chugged around the field and back into an
angle of the grandstand, while the band played loudly.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you how to run it in two days, Dick,”
Morris said, as they circled the diamond. “You’ll
find it’s as easy as anything you ever did.”</p>

<p>“Did you know about it?” asked Dick curiously.</p>

<p>“Sure. It was Gordon’s scheme; but he told me
what he wanted to do and dad and I were strong
for it.”</p>

<p>“But—but where’d they get the money?” asked
Dick.</p>

<p>“They haven’t got it yet,” chuckled Morris. “You
have it!”</p>

<p>“I have<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>Oh, the baseball money!”</p>

<p>“Surest think you know, Dick!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Dick gave a sigh of relief. “I was afraid
they’d paid for it out of their pockets or—or somehow.
I—I knew for two or three weeks that they
were up to something, but I never suspected this.
Say, doesn’t it just get there!”</p>

<p>“She’s a fine little car,” agreed Morris proudly, as
he brought it to a stop behind the extra seats. “And
I’ll just bet you’ll be crazy about her, Dick, in a
week!”</p>

<p>“I guess I’m sort of crazy about her now,” murmured
Dick.</p>

<p>There was still another ceremony to be gone through
with; in fact, two. The first was performed a minute
later when Morris, taking a folded sheet of paper
from his pocket, walked across to the front of the
grandstand, accompanied by the players, and with a
neat but brief speech formally presented the deed of
the athletic field to Mr. Grayson. The principal, however,
wasn’t going to miss the opportunity to indulge
in eloquence, and his speech of thanks went on for
quite five minutes. It was a very good speech, too,
but few heard it, for the spectators out of ear-shot
were clamoring for the game to begin. When he had
finished and bowed and taken his seat again, there
was more applause, and the bass drum boomed ecstatically
and Gordon led three cheers for Mr. Brent, and
at last the home team trotted on to the diamond and
the visitors began passing and warming up at one
side.</p>

<p>By that time it was nearly the hour set for the
game to begin, and almost every available spot on the
field was occupied by spectators. Four of Clearfield’s
modest police force were on duty in the outfield, patrolling
back and forth, restraining the advance of the
crowds which stretched along the continuations of the
foul lines.</p>

<p>On the “press stand,” a kitchen table and two
straight-backed chairs at the end of the home team’s
bench, stood the silver trophy on its ebony stand.
Around the base was twined the purple silk pennant
with the white “C.” At the “press stand” sat Mr.
Potter, his straw hat tilted back on his head, a pile of
yellow copy paper in front of him and a big cigar
tucked in the corner of his mouth. Mr. Potter, looking
proudly about the crowded field, was happy. Apparently
all the pennants had been purchased, for
they waved on all sides, and flashes of purple glowed
everywhere in the sunlight; everywhere, that is to say,
except in one small section of the main stand, where
the Rutter’s Point contingent, some fifty strong, waved
blue-and-yellow flags and cheered for their heroes.</p>

<p>Dick, leaning on his crutches near first base, allowed
his gaze to wander a minute from the work of
his charges toward the crowded seats. There were his
mother and Grace up there, and, farther along, Mr.
and Mrs. Brent and Louise—and Morris just returning
to his place beside them. Strangely enough, Louise
happened to be looking just as Dick glanced her way,
and nodded and waved. Dick took off his hat in answer.
A second later he was bowing again, for Mrs.
Townsend was waving her blue-and-yellow banner
toward him.</p>

<p>Then, presently, the home team yielded the diamond
to the visitors, and Dick went back to the bench with
them. Harold was sharpening his pencils as Dick
took his place beside him.</p>

<p>“Dick,” he said, in a low voice, “I hope you win.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Harold! That’s treachery, isn’t it,
though?”</p>

<p>Harold frowned and shook his head. “Can’t help
it,” he muttered. “I do, anyway.”</p>

<p>The umpires were Mr. Cochran, of the Y.M.C.A.,
chosen by Clearfield, and Mr. Vokes, who had officiated
at the first game between the two teams, the
Point’s selection. The latter gentleman was on bases
and Mr. Cochran umpired at the plate. At twenty
minutes to three Clearfield trotted into the field to
the cheers of the audience, and Gordon, taking a nice
new ball from Mr. Cochran, ascended the stand to
where Mr. Brent sat.</p>

<p>“Mr. Brent,” said Gordon, “we’d like very much to
have you throw out the ball to us, sir, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p>“Throw out the ball!” exclaimed Mr. Brent. “How—how
do I do it?”</p>

<p>“Just stand up, sir, and toss it to Tom Haley, down
there.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brent looked doubtful, but Morris and Louise
urged him on, and finally he got to his feet, measured
the distance anxiously, clutched the ball with a death-like
grip, and hurled it toward Tom. It went a yard
over his head, and was fielded by Harry Bryan near
second! But that didn’t matter! Everyone cheered
just as hard!</p>

<p>Gordon took his position off first base,
thumped fist into glove, and called cheerfully
across to Tom Haley:</p>

<p>“First man, Tom! Let’s have him!”</p>

<p>But Gordon wasn’t nearly as cool and collected as
he tried to seem. He was conscious of the crowd,
and especially of the throng that stretched four and
five deep along the base line but a half dozen yards
away. The noise, too, was disconcerting. He didn’t
mind the bellowing of Jim House back of first, nor
the answering shrieks of Pink Northrop behind third;
but the steady hum and stir of the crowd gave him
what was very much like stage fright. He almost
hoped that the first hit would not come into his territory,
for he was virtually sure that he would misplay
it. But Gordon wasn’t the only one suffering from
nervous embarrassment. Tom was as wild as a hawk,
and if the batsmen had not been up in the air as well
Rutter’s Point might have won the game then and
there!</p>

<p>Dick, none too self-possessed himself, in spite of the
fact that on the bench he was practically out of the
public gaze, saw that in the outfield Way, Jack, and
Fudge were each moving restlessly about, and he mentally
hoped that there would be no long flies for a few
minutes! The only one of the home team who seemed
absolutely self-possessed and unconcerned was Lanny.
Lanny, behind his mask and protector, gave his signals
calmly, and called to Tom coolly and encouragingly,
holding his hands over the center of the plate
and inviting Tom to “put it right here!” And Tom
tried his best to follow signals, and failed lamentably.</p>

<p>Caspar Billings went to base on balls, and Gordon
took the bag. Tom tried one throw across, and
Gordon, to his relief, caught the ball. While Tom had
been in the act of swinging around and stepping out,
Gordon had been sure that the ball would get by him.
Caspar was playing it safe, however, and after Gordon
threw the sphere back to Tom the latter gave his
attention to the next batsman, Loring Townsend.
Loring, with one strike and two balls against him,
reached for a low one and sent it up in the air to Pete
Robey. Pete caught it, juggled it, dropped it, and
then sped it to second. Caspar, who had stopped
halfway down the base line, turned back to the bench.</p>

<p>With one out, Tom settled down a little. Loring
Townsend stole on the second delivery and beat out
the throw. The Point clamored for a hit, but the best
Gil Chase could do was to trickle a slow bunt to Tom,
who threw out the runner at first.</p>

<p>“Two gone!” called Gordon. “Let him hit, Tom!”</p>

<p>But Tom did the hitting himself, bumping Jim
House on the elbow with his first ball. Jim trotted to
first, and Leary came to bat. Leary ought to have
been easy, but he landed on the very first offering and
sent a fly into short left field. Way started with the
ball and got it after a hard run, and the inning was
over.</p>

<p>“We got out of that mighty luckily,” muttered Gordon,
as he took his seat beside Dick. “I guess we’ve
all got nerves.”</p>

<p>“Well, so have the others,” replied Dick. “Try to
get rid of yours first, Gordie.”</p>

<p>Harry Bryan waited and got his base. Will Scott,
instructed to bunt and sacrifice, fouled two attempts,
and finally went out on strikes. Gordon brought the
stands to their feet by a bunt along first-base line which
started well but eventually rolled into foul territory
under the anxious gaze of Mason and Townsend.
Then came a swipe that missed the ball by inches,
then two balls, and last, with two and two, a straight
one that Gordon liked the looks of. He found it, all
right, but it dropped into center-fielder’s hands, and,
with two down, Bryan was still anchored on first. A
minute later he tried a steal, and was caught a yard
away.</p>

<p>In the second Tom pitched better, and Northrop
and Jensen fanned. Houghton, the Point catcher, got
a scratch hit, and reached the first bag but died there
when Mason struck out.</p>

<p>Clearfield did no better in her half, Wayland, Tappen,
and Lanny White going out in order, and only
Jack getting a rap at the ball.</p>

<p>It was not until the fourth inning that things began
to happen. Leary started the Point’s half with a
sharp tap between Pete and Harry that put him
safely on first. Then, with the Point coachers yelling
like mad and dancing like a couple of dervishes, Tom
passed Pink Northrop. With the three tail-enders
coming up there seemed no cause for alarm. But Jensen
laid down a nice bunt right in front of the plate,
and Lanny, tossing aside his mask, picked it up and
hurled it to third. Unfortunately, Will Scott had
started in toward the plate, and the ball got to third
ahead of him. By the time Way had recovered it,
Leary had scored, Northrop was on second, and Jensen
on first. The Pointers went wild with delight, and the
blue-and-yellow flags waved in the grandstand.
Houghton, aching for a hit, was over-anxious, and
fell a victim to the wiles of Lanny and Tom, and
there was one out. Pitcher Mason was no more
of a batsman than the average twirler, and yet he
managed to make it two and three before he
finally put an end to the suspense and the inning
by hitting to Harry Bryan, who tagged Jensen as
he went past and then threw to Gordon, completing
the double.</p>

<p>For the next two innings it looked very much as
though that one run would be enough to win the
game, for Mason settled down and pitched air-tight
ball and added four more strike-outs to his credit.
Tom Haley was less spectacular, and yet got by without
yielding a hit. He passed two batters and in the
sixth Jensen got as far as third when Pete Robey fumbled
Houghton’s liner. But there were no runs scored,
and at the beginning of the seventh the score still
stood 1 to 0 in the visitors’ favor, and Clearfield already
tasted defeat. But the audience shouted that
here was the “lucky seventh,” and those fortunate to
have seats stood up and stretched cramped limbs, and
everyone shouted.</p>

<p>In the first half of the seventh the clouds began to
gather again over Clearfield’s head. Caspar Billings,
first man up, beat out a weak hit and took second when
Townsend sacrificed, Scott to Merrick. A moment
later he reached third when Chase flied out to right
field. Then House provided a half dozen attacks of
heart disease when, with three balls and two strikes
on him, he knocked fouls to nearly every point of the
compass in his endeavor to secure a safe hit and score
Caspar. But in the end Tom tricked him into a high
fly that settled comfortably into Pete Robey’s glove,
and again the sky cleared.</p>

<p>“If those boys don’t win a run this time,” said Mr.
Brent, almost crossly, “I’ll be sorry I gave them the
field.”</p>

<p>“You mean, dad, you’ll be sorry <i>I</i> gave them the
field,” corrected Morris, with a grin. Mr. Brent
grunted.</p>

<p>“Why don’t they bat the ball?” he demanded.
“Every time one of them gets on a base, the others
leave him there. What they ought to do is to take a
good bang at it and send it out there beyond those
fellows.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they’re trying to do, papa,” replied
Louise, “but the Point pitcher won’t let them. He’s
a wonderful pitcher, isn’t he, Morris?”</p>

<p>“Pretty fair. He’ll get his before the game’s over,
though. See if he doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“Get his what?” asked his father curiously.</p>

<p>“Get what’s coming to him,” laughed Morris. “I
mean the Clearfield chaps will bat him. He can’t keep
this pace up much longer. I wouldn’t be surprised if
we got after him this inning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish we might!” sighed Louise. “I wish
they’d just—just <i>slam</i> him!”</p>

<p>“My dear!” murmured Mrs. Brent. “That doesn’t
sound very nice.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, mama; it’s just baseball talk.”</p>

<p>“Even so, dear, I’m not certain,” replied her mother,
“that<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>But Louise didn’t hear the rest, for she was waving
her purple pennant wildly and shrieking in a manner
that Mrs. Brent must have disapproved of thoroughly.
But she had a good excuse. Even Mr. Jonathan Brent
was tapping his cane and breathing hard, while Morris
was frankly on his feet, yelling at the top of his
lungs.</p>

<p>Jack, the first Clearfield batsman, had landed on the
second ball pitched, and now it was rolling along the
grass between right fielder and center, and Jack was
traveling fast for second base. He drew up there,
breathless but happy. From the stands and from the
crowds along the edges of the diamond came shouts
and cheers. At last, Clearfield was to tie the score!</p>

<p>And yet even with a runner on second and only a
hit necessary to bring in a tally, it began to look
as if once more the hopes of Clearfield’s supporters
were doomed. Lanny, determined and cool, after
waiting until he had three balls to his credit and no
strikes, tried to drop out of the way of a close one,
only to have it hit his bat and roll fair! Mason fielded
it to first, and there was one out. The incessant shouting
from the spectators died away and Gordon, coaching
at first, swung on his heel and kicked viciously at
a pebble to relieve his feelings. Then, with Pete
Robey up, there came an exchange of signals, and
Jack started for third as the ball left Mason’s hand
for the second time. It was an unexpected play, and
it succeeded. Pete swung and missed and Houghton
side-stepped and hurled to third. But Jack, who was
a fast youth on his feet, was diving head-first for the
bag when the ball arrived, and Mr. Vokes, trotting
past, spread his hands. Clearfield applauded wildly.</p>

<p>With a man on third, Rutter’s Point considered discretion
the better part of valor, and Mason pitched
out three times to Pete and Pete walked to first, while
the home team’s supporters jeered and shouted disparaging
remarks to Mason. A minute later Pete went
to second unchallenged. Tom Haley was up, and
Houghton had argued that Tom could be easily disposed
of. And it seemed that he could. Tom made
desperate swings at the first two deliveries, and you
could have heard the sighs of despair that came from
the anxious watchers on the seats. Then, heeding the
coachers’ voices at last, Tom got his eye on the ball
and watched idly while Mason sped two wide ones
past him. Then he tried again and a foul resulted,
Houghton getting his hands on it at the edge of the
stand but dropping it. A third ball narrowly escaped
being a strike, and Gordon cried: “That’s waiting,
Tom! Let him walk you; he’ll do it in a minute!”</p>

<p>And he would have, for the next delivery was inches
wide of the outer corner of the plate, but Tom reached
out eagerly, got that ball on the tip of his bat and sent
it arching up in a low fly that fell three feet inside the
first-base foul line and just out of the reach of the
three fielders who raced after it! In trotted Jack,
scoring the tying run, and in sped Pete Robey, close
on his heels, while Clearfield went mad with delight
and the purple pennants waved on high. Pete beat
the throw to the plate by inches, but Tom, trying to
reach second on the throw-in, was less fortunate and
fell victim to a fine heave from Houghton to
Leary.</p>

<p>Dick motioned Fudge to him. “We want another
run, Fudge,” he said softly. “Mason will be up
in the air now. Make him think you’re anxious to
hit. Move up in the box and swing your bat; try to
look nervous<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“I don’t have t-t-t-to try,” muttered Fudge.</p>

<p>“Never mind. Make him think you’ll offer at anything,
but <i>don’t</i> swing but once. Pick out a wide one
and swing at it, Fudge, but be careful not to hit it.
If you work it right, he will pass you sure as shooting!
Now, go ahead.”</p>

<p>Harold Townsend, so excited that he hadn’t scored a
thing since Jack’s two-bagger, looked at Dick in open
admiration. “I guess that’s what they call ‘inside
baseball,’ isn’t it, Dick?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the reply. “It’s what I’d call
horse-sense. I hope it works, anyhow!”</p>

<p>With two out and the bases empty the scoring
was apparently over, and the Pointers were doubtless
already occupying their thoughts with the task before
them of overcoming that one-run lead when they at
last returned to their positions.</p>

<p>“Last man, Mel!” called Billy Houghton. “Let’s
have him!” Then Billy signaled for a straight one.
But Mason, as Dick had predicted, was a bit flustered.
The straight one came over too low and was a ball.
He tried it again, and another ball resulted. Houghton
returned the sphere with a slow and cautioning
toss, and then spread his fingers for a curve. The
curve came, went wide, and Fudge, as nervous as a
wet hen, made a mighty swing at it, missing it by six
inches and winning a laugh from the spectators. Then
he walked to the pitcher’s end of the box and flourished
his bat, and seemed to be daring Mason to put
one where he could get it. Houghton signaled for a
curve once more, for he figured that Fudge was in a
condition to offer at anything that came. And Mason,
winding his fingers none too carefully about the ball,
let drive with it, and was properly surprised when
Fudge made no offer!</p>

<p>Then Houghton woke up. The score was three
balls and one strike. He signaled for one over the
plate, and it came. “Strike!” called Mr. Cochran. On
the bench Dick watched anxiously. If Fudge could
get his base, he reasoned, Harry Bryan would be up,
and, in the present disgruntled state of mind of the
Point players, errors were likely to result. On the
mound Mason was shaking his head at Houghton’s
instructions. He had no doubt that he could put the
third strike over, but he preferred to make the batter
fan. Houghton signaled again, Mason wound up, and
the ball traveled forward. It had a jump on it, if ever
a ball did, and that jump was Mason’s undoing. Fudge
never moved as the ball passed him, only turned inquiringly
toward the umpire. The latter nodded.
“Take your base,” he said.</p>

<p>Billy Houghton ejaculated an amazed “<i>What?</i>”
and Mason disgustedly kicked up the dust, but Fudge,
grinning toward the bench as he passed, trotted to first.
Rutter’s Point suddenly awakened to the fact that perhaps
the trouble was not yet over, after all!</p>

<p>Nor was it. Harry Bryan found something to his
liking, and banged it head-high across the diamond
toward Billings. Caspar knocked it down, fumbled
it, and then threw too late to Townsend. Harry was
safe on first and Fudge on second. Clearfield yelled
like wild Indians, and the crowd swayed and threatened
to push on to the field. Then began a panicky
five minutes.</p>

<p>Fudge danced around at second and Bryan at first.
The coachers shouted and leaped, and the crowd kept
up an incessant thumping of feet and a steady roar
of voices. Up in the main stand, Mr. Jonathan Brent
was hugging his cane and leaning forward from the
very edge of his seat. Louise had her purple pennant
twisted into a hard knot, and Morris was talking
hoarsely to himself or whoever might be listening.
“Take a good lead, Shaw!” he directed. “Look out,
Bryan! He almost got you! Here we go, fellows!
Here we go!” Of course, neither Fudge nor Harry
heard him, but Morris never thought about that. Morris
was running that game for himself just then.</p>

<p>Dick whispered a few words to Jack Tappen, and
Jack sped to first and whispered a few words to Gordon.
And Gordon turned his head inquiringly toward
the bench, caught Dick’s emphatic nod, and renewed
his shouting.</p>

<p>“What did you tell him, Dick?” asked Harold, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>Dick smiled. “You wait and see, Harold,” he said.</p>

<p>Will Scott was up now, with one ball to his credit.
Mason had made three attempts to catch Bryan napping
at first, and now he directed his attention to
the batsman again. A waister went for a strike, a
wide one followed and scored the second ball, and
then Mason wound up once more and shot his arm out.
And as he did so Fudge leaped away toward third,
Bryan sped for second, and a cry of “There he goes!”
went up from the visitors’ bench. Will Scott glued
his eye to that ball, swung and missed it. Houghton
made a desperate attempt to cut off the runner at
third, but failed, and bedlam broke loose. Mr. Potter
knocked the silver trophy off its base in his excitement,
and only caught it at the edge of the “press-stand”
table. Harold kicked his legs in air and tossed his
score-book up. Mr. Anthony Brent nearly broke his
walking-stick. Morris challenged everyone within
hearing to deny that that was the prettiest double steal
that had ever been pulled off. Louise clapped her
hands until her palms ached and her white gloves
threatened to rip. And some six hundred other folks
did whatever it occurred to them to do, and did it
just as noisily as they knew how!</p>

<p>Dick Lovering, Manager of the Clearfield Baseball
Club, only smiled quietly and made little marks in his
score-book.</p>

<p>A minute later Scott was perched on first base, Mason
having been totally unable to locate the plate,
and Gordon faced the pitcher. Bases full, two out, and
the captain at bat! Well, it was a fine situation, no
matter what might come of it. The Point infield crept
toward the plate. Everyone talked loudly to the
pitcher, as much, perhaps, to tranquilize his own
nerves as to encourage Mason. Mason, it seemed,
needed encouragement. He was palpably unstrung,
and the first ball he pitched proved it, for it was as
wild as a shooting-star, and if Billy Houghton had
not leaped sidewise and sprawled on his elbow it would
have been by him and let in a run. But Billy stopped
it, and Fudge scuttled back to safety at third.</p>

<p>Mason worked a slow ball over for a strike on the
next attempt, and that seemed to settle him somewhat.
Gordon let one go by and found he had judged it
correctly. Then a foul back of first base made the standing
two and two. The noise had diminished, and now
an almost breathless silence enveloped the field. Only
the voices of the coachers were to be heard.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on, Fudge! Take a lead! That’s better!
Hold it! On your toes, everyone! Look out for a
passed ball now! Here’s where we score a few!”</p>

<p>“Pick out a good one, Cap! Make him pitch to you!
Here it is! Here it is!”</p>

<p>But Gordon refused to offer at it, and, “Ball!” announced
the umpire.</p>

<p>“It’s got to be good, now, Gordie!” yelled Jack.
“Lean on it! Lean on it! Make it a homer, Cap!”</p>

<p>Mason wound, unwound, sped the ball toward the
plate, bat and ball met and a sudden swelling pæan of
joy went up as the spectators leaped to their feet and
craned their necks. But Gordon, speeding down the
first-base line, and the other runners, spurning the dust
between bags, slowed up and turned disappointedly
back. The hit had gone foul by several yards. A
brand-new ball was thrown to the pitcher, and Gordon
picked up his bat again, waited until the runners
had regained their bases, and then once more faced
Mason.</p>

<p>That new white ball looked good to him! What he
feared most now was that Mason would pitch a bad
one and that he would have to take his base on balls.
To be sure, that would force in another run, but Gordon
wanted more than that. Something told him that
if Mason put one over he could hit it! Perhaps it
would have been well if Mason had sacrificed a run
and passed the Clearfield captain, but Mason couldn’t
be expected to know what was to happen. He wanted
to strike the batsman out and end a deplorable inning,
and Billy Houghton wanted the same thing. And so
Billy spread his hands wide and Mason was just a bit
more careful than usual and the ball sped forward fast
and straight. And Gordon felt his heart jump as he
saw what was coming. Every muscle tightened, his
bat swung sharply, there was a <i>crack</i> that was easily
heard outside the field where an eager army of small
boys had their eyes glued to all available cracks and
knot-holes, and Gordon was racing for first!</p>

<p>Over Leary’s upstretched glove traveled the ball
into the outfield. Jim House made a desperate effort
to get it on the bound, missed it, whirled and scuttled
back toward the fence. It was Pink Northrop, right
fielder, who finally recovered it and threw it frantically
in to second baseman. But by that time three
joyous youths had crossed the plate and Gordon was
sliding, in a cloud of dust, to third. And he might
have kept his feet, at that, for poor Caspar, seeing the
game slipping away, muffed the throw. Gordon had
come through with a clean three-bagger! The score
stood five to one! The “lucky seventh” had proved
itself!</p>

<p style='width:343px'>“The Lucky Seventh had proved itself”</p>
</div>

<p>The inning ended two minutes later when Way was
an easy out, shortstop to first, and Rutter’s Point again
took up the bat. But four runs was a desperate handicap
to overcome, and Tom Haley, encouraged by success,
pitched the best ball of his career. To be sure,
Rutter’s Point did score once more, in the first of the
ninth, Caspar Billings slamming out a two-bagger
much too hot for Pete Robey to handle and sending
Jensen across the plate. And after that Townsend got
to first on an error by Will Scott, and the Point, with
Gil Chase at bat, tried heroically to pull the game out
of the fire by a ninth-inning rally. But Tom was not
to be trifled with, and Chase finally went out on a long
fly to center, which Fudge, making the most of his second
chance of the game, pulled down without a
tremor!</p>

<p>And then the band crashed forth into a triumphant
march, the stands emptied, the field was flooded with
laughing, satisfied spectators, cheers were given and
answered, and, surrounded by a dense throng of enthusiastic
admirers, Gordon and Dick and the others
tried to hear Mr. Potter’s speech as he presented to
them the silver cup and the silken pennant. That
speech appeared in full in Monday’s <i>Reporter</i>, together
with three columns of descriptive matter
and a detailed story of the game; but no one heard
it now.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Dick, the trophy held on his
knees, sat in the blue runabout, and, with the triumphant
Clearfield nine following behind, was paraded
thrice around the field, Morris acting as charioteer.
And the crowd, loitering behind to miss none of the
fun, scuttled aside and cheered and waved purple
flags.</p>

<p>Last of all, with a score-book somewhat the worse
for wear clutched tightly under his arm, strode Harold,
adding his shrill cheers to the general tumult.</p>

<h2 id='c25'>CHAPTER XXV<br/>“THE LUCKY SEVENTH”</h2>

<p>On a crisp and sunny Saturday morning, a fortnight
after the game, a blue runabout automobile
came quietly and circumspectly along
Troutman Street, under the yellowing maples, and,
with two gruff toots of its horn, slowed down and
came to a stop in front of the Merricks’ gate. As the
driver of the car slid the gears into neutral and kicked
off the switch at the battery, a look of relief succeeded
the somewhat strained and anxious expression he had
worn. I think he even sighed his satisfaction as he
relaxed his grasp of the steering wheel and looked
toward the doorway. Along the running-board on
the driver’s side of the car lay a pair of crutches, held
in place by an ingenious contrivance of heavy wire.</p>

<p>After that, there is no use trying to longer conceal
the identity of the boy at the wheel. It was Dick. A
week of instruction by Morris and a second week spent
in operating alone had made him a fairly competent
driver, but he had not yet passed the stage where a
corner was something to be approached with vast anxiety
and to be negotiated with care and deliberation.
Every inch of the blue varnished surface of the car
shone resplendently, and every particle of brass was
polished until it was painful to view.</p>

<p>Two more blasts of the grumpy horn at last produced
results. The screen door flew open, and Gordon,
a piece of toast in one hand and a napkin in the
other, appeared.</p>

<p>“Say, what time do you think it is?” he demanded
laughingly.</p>

<p>“It’s time you were through breakfast, anyway,” responded
Dick. “Get a hustle on. <i>Eli</i> hates to stand.”
(Dick had named the car <i>Eli Yale</i> because of its color,
but generally referred to it as <i>Eli</i>.)</p>

<p>“I’ll bring a lump of sugar for him,” said Gordon.
“Keep a tight rein on him, Dick, and I’ll be with you
in five minutes. Maybe he will stand long enough for
you to come in and have a cup of coffee.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t dare risk it,” replied Dick gravely. “Besides,
I never take coffee in the middle of the forenoon.”</p>

<p>“Middle of the forenoon!” grunted the other. “It
isn’t half-past eight yet! Since you got that car, you
never go to bed at all, I guess!”</p>

<p>Gordon vanished with that, and Dick leaned
comfortably back in the runabout to wait. But an instant
later a speck of tarnish on the dash clock—a gift from
Louise Brent—caught his eye, and he whisked a piece
of cheesecloth from a pocket on the inside of the door
and attacked it indignantly. Before he had conquered
it, returned the cloth and buttoned the flap again, Gordon
appeared once more, capped and ready for the
ride.</p>

<p>“All set?”</p>

<p>Dick looked carefully at levers and switch. “All
set,” he said.</p>

<p>Gordon turned the handle half over, and <i>Eli</i> broke
into a frantic chugging that could be heard six blocks
away. Dick pushed back the throttle and pulled down
the spark, however, and <i>Eli</i> moderated his transports.
Gordon, who had clapped his hands to his ears, grinned
as he climbed in beside Dick and slammed the door.
“Gee,” he said, “but he’s some noisy!”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” denied Dick indignantly. “He naturally
chortles a little at times.”</p>

<p>“Oh, was he chortling? I thought he was champing
his bit. Hello, see who’s here!” added Gordon, as the
car swayed across B Street. A lusty shouting was
heard, and Fudge came racing along the sidewalk.
Dick stopped.</p>

<p>“W-w-where you going?” panted Fudge. “Take
me, too, Dick. You haven’t given me a ride yet!”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Dick. “Open the door and sit
on the edge there, Fudge. But don’t drag your big
feet and stop the car.”</p>

<p>“Go get your cap,” advised Gordon.</p>

<p>“Don’t need a cap. Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just for a ride,” replied Dick, throwing in his
clutch again after a calculating survey of the empty
street.</p>

<p>“The Springdale road’s pretty good,” suggested
Gordon, with a wink at Fudge.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d run out toward the Point,” said Dick
carelessly. “You don’t meet many teams that way.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” asked Gordon, “when do they move
in?”</p>

<p>“Who?” Dick inquired.</p>

<p>“The Brents, of course.” Fudge giggled.</p>

<p>Dick laughed. “Who said anything about the
Brents, you idiot?”</p>

<p>“No one; only you spoke of going to the Point. You
can drop Fudge and me at the hotel. We don’t want
to be in the way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you run along and play!” said Dick good-naturedly.
“If you really want to know when they’re
coming back to town, I’ll tell you. They’re going to
move in next Wednesday. Morris says it’s too hard
to get to school on time. And since football practice
has begun<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>” Dick broke off to negotiate a corner.</p>

<p>“Morris is crazy to think he can play this Fall,” said
Fudge. “He will bust his leg again. You’ll see.”</p>

<p>“He’s going to try, anyway,” said Gordon. “They’re
going to mark out the gridiron this morning, Dick.”</p>

<p>“That so? Oh, by the way, I heard from Harold.
I’ve got his letter here somewhere. Steady the wheel
a minute, Gordie, will you?” Dick drew forth an envelope
from his pocket and handed it across. “Read
it aloud.”</p>

<p style='margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;'>“‘Dear Dick,’” read Gordon, “‘I passed all right.
Only I have got to do some extra Math this term. I
was sort of rotten on Math. Old Penny (he’s the
principal) says I did better than lots of fellows who
come here. Loring said I was to thank you, and I do
awfully, Dick. You were fine and dandy to me, and I
am sorry I was such a rotter at first. And I am very
sorry about the Math. It wasn’t your fault, Dick.
Please remember me to the fellows, and tell them I
am coming back next year. I am going out for the
junior baseball team next week and maybe next summer
I can play for you, Dick, if you want me. Loring
says remember him to you, and so no more at
present from your firm friend,</p>
<p style='margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em; text-align:right; margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>Harold.’”</p>

<p>“‘Firm friend’ is pretty good,” commented Gordon,
as he folded the letter up and returned it to its
envelope. “But I’m glad the kid passed, if only on your
account, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Yes; if he had failed, I’d have felt sort of mean
about taking the money. Speaking of money, fellows,”
he continued, as the runabout slid across the
trolley tracks and headed toward Rutter’s Point, “Mr.
Potter sent me the statement this morning. I didn’t
bring it, though.”</p>

<p>“How did we come out?” asked Gordon. “About
the way we figured?”</p>

<p>“Nearly forty dollars better. There were six hundred
and thirty-three paid admissions to the game,
amounting to four hundred and three dollars. The
total expenses were, I think, sixty-one dollars; or maybe
they were sixty-three. Anyway, the net profits
amount to three hundred and forty-two dollars. That
includes four dollars and something made on the pennants
sold.”</p>

<p>“Peanuts?” exclaimed Fudge. “I didn’t know
we<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Pennants, stupid!” corrected Gordon. “Well, that’s
doing pretty well, Dick. Then, after paying for the
car, we have money left?”</p>

<p>“Over fifty dollars,” was the reply. “What shall
we do with it?”</p>

<p>“G-g-give it to me,” suggested Fudge.</p>

<p>“I think you ought to have it for gasoline and tires,”
laughed Gordon. “This thing will keep you poor, I’m
afraid, Dick.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied the owner of the car seriously.
“I’m studying up on autos, and I’m going to make my
own repairs. And I’ve sent for a vulcanizing outfit
that only costs three dollars and a half. When I get
that I can fix my own tires. As for gasoline, why, <i>Eli</i>
only drinks a gallon every twenty miles! And I don’t
run that far in three days! I think it would be a good
plan to hand over what we have left to the Athletic
Committee, Gordie. They’ll need a lot of money now
that we own the field. We’ll have to pay the taxes and
for water and other things.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. As far as I’m concerned<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“Remember this place?” interrupted Dick.</p>

<p>Gordon nodded. “Yes; that’s where Morris steered
the car into the fence and me into the bushes.”</p>

<p>“It’s where you became a blooming hero,” said
Fudge.</p>

<p>“Hero, nothing! What I did didn’t amount to a
row of pins!”</p>

<p>“Well, it amounted to the gift of an athletic field to
the school,” said Dick, with a smile. “That’s something,
you know!”</p>

<p>“And it amounted to something else, t-t-too,” added
Fudge. “It made Morris a respectable member of
s-s-s-society!”</p>

<p>“What beautiful expressions you do use, Fudge!”
laughed Gordon.</p>

<p>“Fudge is right, though,” agreed Dick, when he
had carefully steered the car around a wagon. “Morris
is a heap more—more likable than he was last year.
Whether it was the accident<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“It jarred some of the nonsense out of him, perhaps,”
said Gordon. “Although, for that matter, Dick,
maybe you like him better for other reasons.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Dick, with a suspicious sidelong
glance. Fudge chuckled.</p>

<p>“Even you and Morris’ father seem to be getting
quite chummy,” pursued Gordon, “while as for Mrs.
Brent, why, she’s absolutely spoony about you!”</p>

<p>“Go ahead and enjoy yourself,” said Dick. “I
don’t mind your ravings. Looks as though they were
getting ready to close the hotel, doesn’t it?” he added,
as they took the corner cautiously and turned into the
shore road.</p>

<p>“I should think they would. About everyone has
gone. Did I tell you what Caspar Billings said at the
station the other day?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. What was it?”</p>

<p>“He said he was going to send circulars of the hotel
to all the prep schools next Spring, so he could get
up a nine that would beat us next summer and get that
pennant back!”</p>

<p>“L-l-let him!” sputtered Fudge. “We’ll be ready
for them!”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, for we’ll have Mr. Harold Townsend
playing for us,” said Gordon. “By the way, Dick,
we’d better put him in center field, don’t you
think?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“That’s all r-r-right!” exploded Fudge. “P-p-put
him there! I’m going to p-p-p-play in the infield next
s-s-s-summer! I’m g-g-going<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>But Fudge’s remarks were drowned by the sudden
croaking of the horn as the blue runabout approached
the Brents’ cottage.</p>

<p>“There’s Morris on the porch,” said Dick, adding
another dismal warning.</p>

<p>“Yes, and—am I mistaken, or is that<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span> My
sight isn’t what it used to be, Fudge. Look and tell
me if that is Louise on the steps.”</p>

<p>“Dry up!” muttered Dick, turning the car toward
the curb and throwing out the clutch.</p>

<p>Morris and Louise came down the walk. “Some
driving, that, Dick,” Morris applauded.</p>

<p>“Oh, I told him what to do!” said Gordon modestly.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mister Manager,” greeted Louise.
“Good morning, Mister Captain. Good morning, Mister<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>” She
paused, at a loss.</p>

<p>“Mister Historian,” supplied Gordon. “Fudge is
writing a beautiful story about the game, aren’t you,
Fudge? He’s going to call it<span style='letter-spacing: -4px;'>——</span>”</p>

<p>“C-c-cut it out!” growled Fudge.</p>

<p>“Please tell me, Fudge,” begged Louise. “What
<i>are</i> you going to call it?”</p>

<p>Fudge scowled, grinned, and relented.</p>

<p>“I’m g-g-going to c-c-c-call it,” he said, “‘The
Lucky Seventh.’”</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
